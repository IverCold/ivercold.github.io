            <p><strong>Skills</strong></p>
            <p>
                You cant use Effort for Social Skills.
                <br />To modify the difficulty of the social interaction task you need to use Skills and Assets.
                <br />Abilities which give free level of Effort for social interactions count as "Ease Task"
                ("Shrugs Off Disappointment" from Optimistic Descriptor, "A Smile and a Word" from Speaks With A Silver
                Tongue focus).
                Disguise skill (and some variants of monster's Decieving skill) are not the subject for this rule. They
                can be counted as Stealth skill.
            </p>

            <p><strong>Recovery Rolls</strong></p>
            <p>Recovery rolls can be used in any order. This rule excludes 10-hour recovery roll - it's must be
                the last in the given day</p>
            <p>Using 1 action recovery roll eases all character defence rolls (Speed, Might and Intellect) until
                the next round.</p>

            <p><strong>AoE Abilities</strong></p>
            <p>If AoE ability initial roll is failed than area is moved in the direction decided by d8 roll
                (scatter).</p>
            <p>Also this abilities deal 1 point of ambient damage at minimum.</p>

            <p><strong>Cooperative actions (Discovery, p118)</strong></p>
            <p><u>Helping:</u></p>
            <p>
                If you use your action to help someone with a task, you ease the task.
                <br />If you have an inability in that task, your help has no effect.
                <br />If your level in that task is equal, the task is eased by one step.
                <br />If your level in that task is lower, you give +1 to roll.
                <br />Help is considered an asset, and someone receiving help usually can't gain more than two
                assets on a single task.
            </p>

            <p><u>Complementary Action:</u></p>
            <p>
                Sometimes you can help by performing a
                task that complements what another person
                is attempting. If your complementary action
                succeeds, you ease the other person’s task.
            </p>

            <p><u>Draw the Attack:</u></p>
            <p>
                When an NPC attacks a character, another PC can prominently present herself, shout taunts, and
                move to try to get the foe to attack her instead.
                <br />In most cases, this action succeeds without a roll — the opponent attacks the prominent PC
                instead of their companions.
                <br />In other cases, such as with intelligent or determined foes, the prominent character must
                succeed at an Intellect action to draw the attack. In the case of the long range Speed Task 4 is
                required.
                <br />The difficulty of the prominent character’s defense tasks is modified by one step to her
                detriment.
            </p>

            <p><u>Distraction:</u></p>
            <p>
                When a character uses their turn to distract a foe, that foe’s attacks are hindered for one
                round.
            </p>
            <p><u>Take the Attack:</u></p>
            <p>
                A character can use her action to throw herself in front of a foe’s successful attack to save a
                nearby comrade.
                <br />In this case next character action is sacrificed.
                <br />The attack automatically succeeds against the sacrificial character, and it deals 1
                additional point of
                damage.
                <br />A character cannot willingly take more than one attack each round in this way.
            </p>

            <p><strong>Acting While Under Attack (Discovery, p331)</strong></p>
            <p>This rule works only either for enemies that attacked PC in melee last round or for enemies that
                were attacked by PC last round.</p>
            <p>
                When a character is engaged in melee combat, doing anything other than fighting makes them more
                vulnerable. This is true for PCs and NPCs.
                <br />If a character engaged in melee takes an action other than fighting, each of their
                opponents can make an immediate extra attack.
                <br />The only exception to this rule is moving. If the character’s only action is to move, they
                are assumed to be moving slowly and carefully out of the fight, safely withdrawing from combat.
