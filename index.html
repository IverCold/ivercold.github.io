                    <h3><strong>Experience Points</strong></h3>

                    <p>There are two types of earned experience points (XP).</p>

                    <p><strong>XP earned throughout the game can be spent on:</strong></p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Reroll any d20 roll.</li>
                        <li>Gain a free 1 step reduction on any roll.</li>
                        <li>Refuse a GM intrusion.</li>
                        <li>Augment a Power, Cypher, Artifact or Device in a fantastical nature.</li>

                        <li>[2xp] Gain a skill that provides a short-term benefit. This is story-based.</li>
                        <ul>For example, a character can spend 2 XP while climbing through mountains and say that she
                            has experience with climbing in regions like these, or perhaps she spends the XP after she’s
                            been in the mountains for a while and says that she’s picked up the feel for climbing there.
                            Either way, from now on, she is trained in climbing in those mountains. This helps her now
                            and any time she returns to the area, but she’s not trained in climbing everywhere. Another
                            example is that a character notices that all the locks in the Citadel of the Iron Saint are
                            similar. She spends 2 XP and says that she is trained in picking locks in the Citadel of the
                            Iron Saint.</ul>
                        <br />
                        <li>[2xp] Gain a new ability (device, esotery, mental power) that provides a short-term benefit,
                            usually no longer that the course of one scenario. This is story-based.</li>
                        <ul>For example, a character who wants to explore a submerged location has several numenera
                            components, and they spend 2 XP to cobble together a device for breathing underwater. This
                            gives them the ability for a considerable length of time, but not permanently—the device
                            might work for only eight hours.</ul>
                        <br />

                        <li>Use Player Intrusion.</li>
                        <ul>
                            A player intrusion should always involve a small aspect of the world beyond the character.
                            They should not end an encounter, should not have a wide-reaching or long-term effect.
                            Player intrusions can affect a single object (a floorboard snaps), feature (there's a hidden
                            shallow spot in the stream to ford), or NPC (the vendor is an old friend of mine). But not
                            more than that.
                            The GM can always overrule a player intrusion or suggest a way to fit it better.
                        </ul>
                        <br />
                    </ol>

                    <p><strong>XP earned between games (for exploration and achieved goals) are spent on character
                            advancement.</strong></p>
                    <p>Progressing to the next tier involves five steps. Each step costs 5 XP. Steps can be purchased in
                        any order, but each can be purchased only once per tier. When a character has spent XP on each
                        of the five steps, they advance to the next tier.</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>You Effort score increases by 1.</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>This step is taken only on 1, 3, and 5 tiers. On 2 and 4 tiers Type ability is taken
                                instead.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <li>You gain 4 new points to add to your stat Pools. You can allocate the points among your
                            Pools however you wish.</li>
                        <li>You add 1 to your Might Edge, your Speed Edge, or your Intellect Edge (your choice).</li>
                        <li>One of:</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Skills: Chose one skill other than attacks or defense. You become trained in that skill.
                                You can even choose a skill based on your character&rsquo;s special abilities. For
                                example, if your character can make an Intellect roll to blast an enemy with mental
                                force, you can become trained in using that ability, easing the task of using it. If you
                                choose a skill that you are already trained in, you become specialized in that skill,
                                easing the task by two steps instead of one. If you choose a skill that you have an
                                inability in, the training and the inability cancel each other out (you aren&rsquo;t
                                eased or hindered in that task).</li>
                            <li>Add 2 to your recovery rolls.</li>
                            <li>Reduce the cost for wearing armor. This option lowers the Speed Effort cost by 1. </li>
                        </ul>
                        <li>One of:</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Type ability. The type ability esotery must be from your tier or a lower tier.&nbsp;
                            </li>
                            <li>Select another focus ability available to you at tier 3. (You must be tier 3 or higher
                                to do this. Characters advancing beyond tier 6 can use this option to select their other
                                tier 6 focus option.)</li>
                            <li>Special story ability if applicable (cost varies).</li>
                        </ul>
                    </ol>

                    <h2><strong>Skills</strong></h2>
                    <p>If in Descriptor, Type or Focus narrow skills are indicated then you should take them. Common
                        skills that include these narrow skills will give your specialization in this narrow skill.</p>
                    <p>For example, if Descriptor gives you training in Climbing, then if you take training in Athletics
                        later, you will get specialization in Climbing.</p>
                    <p>Such cases also include social skills: pleasant &amp; positive social interactions, detecting
                        hidden motives, etc.</p>
                    <p><strong>Special skills:</strong></p>
                    <p>These skills require detailed knowledge. If you aren&rsquo;t trained or specialized in this
                        skill, you have an inability in the skill (you&rsquo;re hindered whenever you attempt that
                        task).</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Understanding Numenera</li>

                        <li>Salvaging Numenera</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Crafting Numenera, in addition to its main uses, allows you to understand how something was built
                        or what kind of protection the creature has (even if it is inanimate).</p>
                    <p>Salvaging Numenera, The skill, in addition to its main uses, allows you to understand how to
                        destroy something and what are the vulnerabilities of the creature (even if it is alive).</p>
                    <p>To take a specialization in Understanding Numenera you must choose one of two options below:</p>

                    <p><strong>Recovery Rolls</strong></p>
                    <p>Recovery rolls can be used in any order. This rule excludes 10-hour recovery roll - it's must be
                        the last in the given day</p>
                    <p>Using 1 action recovery roll eases all charater defence rolls: Speed, Might and Intellect.</p>

                    <p>If AoE ability initial roll is failed than area is moved in the direction decided by d8 roll
                        (scatter).</p>
                    <p>Also this abilities deal 1 point of ambient damage at minimum.</p>

                        If you use your action to help someone with a task, you ease the task.
                        <br />If you have an inability in that task, your help has no effect.
                        <br />If your level in that task is equal, the task is eased by one step.
                        <br />If your level in that task is lower, you give +1 to roll.
                        <br />Help is considered an asset, and someone receiving help usually can't gain more than two
                        assets on a single task.
                    </p>

                    <p><u>Complementary Action:</u></p>
                    <p>
                        Sometimes you can help by performing a
                        task that complements what another person
                        is attempting. If your complementary action
                        succeeds, you ease the other person’s task.
                    </p>

                    <p><u>Draw the Attack:</u></p>
                    <p>
                        When an NPC attacks a character, another PC can prominently present herself, shout taunts, and
                        move to try to get the foe to attack her instead.
                        <br />In most cases, this action succeeds without a roll — the opponent attacks the prominent PC
                        instead of their companions.
                        <br />In other cases, such as with intelligent or determined foes, the prominent character must
                        succeed at an Intellect action to draw the attack. In the case of the long range Speed Task 4 is
                        required.
                        <br />The difficulty of the prominent character’s defense tasks is modified by one step to her
                        detriment.
                    </p>

                    <p><u>Distraction:</u></p>
                    <p>
                        When a character uses their turn to distract a foe, that foe’s attacks are hindered for one
                        round.
                    </p>
                    <p><u>Take the Attack:</u></p>
                    <p>
                        A character can use her action to throw herself in front of a foe’s successful attack to save a
                        nearby comrade.
                        <br />In this case next character action is sacrificed.
                        <br />The attack automatically succeeds against the sacrificial character, and it deals 1
                        additional point of
                        damage.
                        <br />A character cannot willingly take more than one attack each round in this way.
                    </p>

                    <p><strong>Acting While Under Attack (Discovery, p331)</strong></p>
                    <p>This rule works only either for enemies that attacked PC in melee last round or for enemies that
                        were attacked by PC last round.</p>
                    <p>
                        When a character is engaged in melee combat, doing anything other than fighting makes them more
                        vulnerable. This is true for PCs and NPCs.
                        <br />If a character engaged in melee takes an action other than fighting, each of their
                        opponents can make an immediate extra attack.
                        <br />The only exception to this rule is moving. If the character’s only action is to move, they
                        are assumed to be moving slowly and carefully out of the fight, safely withdrawing from combat.
