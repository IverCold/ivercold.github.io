    "Name": "Acts Without Consequence",
    "Source": "Destiny",
    "Flavor": "You’re a rebel. You resist the dictates of authority, you try to break away from the control that society holds over you, and you like to flout traditions that you view as backward. That’s not to say that you automatically disagree with anything or anyone you deal with. It’s more that you believe certain institutions and conventions are foolish and even hurtful. This is why you often press your luck and defy the status quo. Often enough, you get away with it.<br><br> In fact, your success is more than a mere twist of statistics. You enjoy some kind of psychic enhancement, implanted device, or attention of a datasphere spirit. You’ve also practiced certain skills, behaviors, and attitudes that allow blame to slip off you like water off a murden. A character who acts without consequence often dresses in flamboyant garments designed to draw the eye, as if they’re tempting the universe to notice them after all. Those who can successfully act without consequence could walk into the center of a city square, steal a fruit from a vendor, pass it to a beggar in full view of everyone, and suffer no repercussions whatsoever. Glaives, Jacks, Delves, and Arkai are drawn to acting without consequence.",
