                Absorbs Energy
            </td>
            <td>
                Every movement is an expression of energy. You can harness this kinetic energy and transform it into
                other kinds of energy. At first, once you absorb energy, you must use it before you can absorb any more.
                You can use the absorbed energy as a weapon, or you can infuse an object with dangerous energy that is
                released upon touch. Eventually, you will be able to use the energy for nonviolent purposes, such as
                healing or invigorating creatures.

                Glaives often gain the biggest benefit from being energy absorbers, as they are the ones most often
                being struck in combat, and many of the initial uses of absorbed energy are for combat. However, Wrights
                can potentially use some of that energy to improve their crafting abilities.

                <b>Absorb Kinetic Energy:</b> You absorb a portion of the energy of a physical attack or impact. You
                negate 1 point of damage you would have suffered and store that point as energy. Once you have absorbed
                1 point of energy, you continue to negate 1 point of damage from any incoming blow or impact, but the
                residual energy bleeds off with a flare of harmless light (you cannot store more than 1 point at a
                time). Enabler.<br><br><b>Release Energy:</b> You release 1 point of energy you’ve absorbed (magnifying
                and focusing it into a blast of energy) that strikes a single foe within long range for 4 points of
                damage. If you don’t have any kinetic energy absorbed, you can still use this ability, but it requires
                that you transform a fraction of yourself into the blast, which costs 1 point of Might. A character can
                use Release Energy in place of io while crafting the numenera. One point of damage equals 1 unit of io.

            <td>
                <b>Energize Object:</b> You infuse energy you have absorbed into an object, like a weapon. The object
                holds the energy until it is touched by anyone but you, so putting it into your melee weapon or the ammo
                of a ranged weapon allows the weapon to trigger the energy in combat. The energy inflicts 3 points of
                damage on the creature touched in addition to any damage the weapon itself might do. You cannot have
                more than one energized object on your person at a time. Action to initiate.<br>

                (focused light, radiation, transdimensional, psychic, etc.) or from conduits that direct energy, if you
                can make direct contact. This ability does not change how many points of energy you can store. If you
                also have Improved Absorb Kinetic Energy, you can absorb 2 points of damage from other energy sources as
                well. Enabler.<br><br><b>Improved Absorb Kinetic Energy:</b> Instead of being able to absorb 1 point of
                damage from a physical attack or impact, you can absorb 2 points. You can also store up to 2 points of
                energy from any source. However, you can still only release energy 1 point at a time. Enabler.<br>

                for one hour. That creature, however, cannot release excess energy as a blast. For each level of Effort
                you apply, you can increase the number of targets you affect by one. If you have Absorb Pure Energy or
                Improved Absorb Kinetic Energy, those abilities are also duplicated in your target when you use Energize
                Creature. Action to initiate.<br>

                creatures within short range so that they also can absorb energy from physical attacks and impacts for
                one hour. If you have Absorb Pure Energy or Improved Absorb Kinetic Energy, these creatures can use
                those abilities as well. The creatures, however, cannot release excess energy as a blast. When you use
                Energize Crowd on a crowd of people pledged to defend a ranked community or a horde from attack, the
                community or horde gains +1 Armor. Action to initiate.<br><br><b>Overcharge Device:</b> You infuse 1
                point of energy you’ve stored into a device, such as an artifact or installation, which raises its
                effective level on its next use by 3 (to a maximum of 10). Enabler.<br>

                You’re a rebel. You resist the dictates of authority, you try to break away from the control that
                society holds over you, and you like to flout traditions that you view as backward. That’s not to say
                that you automatically disagree with anything or anyone you deal with. It’s more that you believe
                certain institutions and conventions are foolish and even hurtful. This is why you often press your luck
                and defy the status quo. Often enough, you get away with it.<br><br>In fact, your success is more than a
                mere twist of statistics. You enjoy some kind of psychic enhancement, implanted device, or attention of
                a datasphere spirit. You’ve also practiced certain skills, behaviors, and attitudes that allow blame to
                slip off you like water off a murden. A character who acts without consequence often dresses in
                flamboyant garments designed to draw the eye, as if they’re tempting the universe to notice them after
                all.
                Those who can successfully act without consequence could walk into the center of a city square, steal a
                fruit from a vendor, pass it to a beggar in full view of everyone, and suffer no repercussions
                whatsoever.

                can regain the remaining invisibility effect by taking an action to hide your position. If you have a
                type ability that also confers invisibility, using either ability allows you to remain invisible for

                You have the power to command the Leviathan—your name for the horrific things that wait in the empty
                ruins or hunt in the dark beyond the town walls, creatures with long teeth, hellish fury, and a hunger
                for human flesh. The Leviathan is the spirit of the predatory, the monstrous, and the sociopathic.
                Sometimes, you suspect the term applies to a specific variety of creature, all descended from a literal
                entity called the Leviathan—a bloodline you perhaps share in some small way, explaining why you can
                command and control these terrible creatures that preferentially hunt humans over all other

                residence in certain creatures, though others suggest the same as you believe - it is a strain of life
                that corrupts and changes what it touches. Metaphorically, it’s easy to say that all living, nonhuman
                predators are of the Leviathan. But you have a feeling, even if you’ve not said it in so many words yet,

                Machines can be upgraded and improved, and the human body is just an organic machine. Your goal is to
                keep improving your physical form, replacing obsolete parts of your body with new grafts and trying to
                become supremely efficient at your normal and augmented biological processes. Whether you do this with
                technology or pieces from other creatures depends on what you find in your explorations and your
                estimation of your flaws and shortcomings. You don’t believe it’s possible to achieve
                perfection—perfection is an ongoing process, not a final state. If following this path makes you
                something more than human, so be it. You left behind childish toys and forms to become an adult, so you
                are willing to leave your humanity behind in order to become something greater.<br><br>Glaives see
                grafting as a way to increase their physical power and survive attacks from dangerous opponents. Delves
                often have many opportunities to find and use grafts, and Wrights can use their own knowledge of the
                numenera to craft custom limbs and other body grafts for themselves.
                Grafting flesh for cosmetic purposes doesn’t count as a grafted cypher. Many characters with this focus
                graft parts from their enemies and show them off like trophies.
                Grafters can experiment with adding grafts to other creatures, but the process is painful and prone to
                failure. Amoral grafters usually keep multiple “volunteers" on hand for experimentation.

                “Wait here, and attack anyone who comes within short range until they’re dead.” The servant lasts for
                ten minutes, is a level 5 creature, and deals 1 extra point of damage from fire when it attacks. Action

                through it, potentially catching them on fire for an additional 1 point of damage each round (if they

                Anyone can use a shield. But few can project a protective force field that crackles with otherworldly
                energy. Maybe your ability comes from a childhood encounter with a strange machine or a metallic nodule
                that protrudes above your flesh along your spine, or perhaps it is something that people in your family
                are capable of once every few generations. You use your force field to not only protect yourself, but to
                aggressively bash those who would do you harm. At first, you can create only a small protective plane.
                But as your skills improve, you can learn to throw it at foes and have it rebound, heal allies, and
                release an explosion of destructive energy each time it strikes home.<br><br>Glaives and Delves are most

                <b>Breaker:</b> You are trained in tasks related to damaging objects with the goal of breaking,
                piercing, or demolishing them. Objects have a damage track that works like the damage track for PCs. 
                Intact is the default state for an object. Minor damage is a slightly damaged state. 
                An object with minor damage reduces its level by 1. Major damage is a critically damaged state.
                An object with major damage is broken and no longer functions. Destroyed is destroyed. The object is ruined,
                no longer functions, and cannot be repaired. It is a Might action to damage an object, and on a success, 
                the object moves one step down the object damage track. If the Might roll exceeds the difficulty by two steps, 
                the object instead moves two steps down the object damage track. If the Might roll exceeds the difficulty by
                four steps, the object moves three steps down the object damage track and is immediately destroyed.
                Brittle material reduces the effective level of the object, while hard material like wood or stone adds

                You know that style is at least as important as substance. Defeating foes is secondary to looking good
                while doing it. Some might call you a swashbuckler or daredevil. You leap through the air, make a
                flourish with your weapon, and attack, usually with a clever, biting show of wit. Your enemies hate you,
                but your allies adore you. Just watching you fight is entertaining.<br><br>You very likely wear no
                armor, instead preferring stylish clothing—perhaps even a hat with a feather.<br><br>Jacks and Glaives
                make the best swashbucklers, and they are the most common types of characters to fight with panache.

                room, and an average fit human could do it with their arms, you can do it with your psychokinesis. You
                only have to use the power’s Might Pool, Might Edge, and Effort if a PC would have to do so, such as if
                a character tried to push open a barred door. For example, you could lift and pull a light object
                anywhere within range to yourself or move a heavy object (like a piece of furniture) about 10 feet (3

                percent chance of being a creature of up to level 5. The creature has no memory of anything before being
                called by you, though it can speak and has the general knowledge a creature of its type should possess.

                (as if using Psychokinetic Attack, except the task is eased by four steps instead of three), or you can
                attempt a crafting task to reshape the object into another form. Reshaping an object usually has a

                When you move, your body changes state and becomes partially phased, reflecting a bizarre alternate
                dimension where distance and time are different than they are in the Ninth World. It’s only when you’re
                still that you remain solid and fully part of the real world. Sometimes that’s a relief, but other times
                you feel like you’re stuck in wet sand. Moving is your key to changing phase—and perhaps happiness.
                While you’re phased, you skate along the surface of reality far more quickly than others. Such rapid
                movement across normal reality sometimes leaves behind scratches, which you can selectively make,

                some attacks pass through you harmlessly. While phased, you gain an asset to your Speed defense tasks,
                but you lose any benefit from armor you wear. Note that some of your other special abilities enable
                specific actions that you can take while using Phase Sprint. For instance, when using Disrupting Touch,
                you can make one touch attack while moving (though this ends your movement). You don’t have to run in
                one long, straight line when using Phase Sprint, but can instead choose to zig and zag, curve, or even

                Phase Sprint into a melee attack by purposefully grazing another creature as you run. When you do, the
                touch releases a violent blast of energy that inflicts 2 points of damage to the target (ignores Armor).
                Whether you hit or miss, your movement (and turn) ends immediately, which puts you within immediate

                Walls of the World attack abilities is also eased by two steps; however, if you attack a creature,

                ominous humming or buzzing sound emitted by the target. But on your next turn, the resonance shatters
                discrete inanimate objects, inflicts major damage to structures and installations, or inflicts 4 points

                and terrain features shed debris and rubble. Each round, creatures in the area take either 3 points of
                damage due to the general shaking, or 6 points of damage if in or adjacent to a structure or terrain
                feature shedding debris. If Earthquake is used against a ranked community or horde, the quake inflicts 3

                points of damage and is stunned on its next action. If the target is a PC of any tier, they move down
                one step on the damage track. In addition to the normal options for using Effort, you can choose to use
                Effort to affect a more powerful target (one level of Effort means a target of up to level 3 explodes
                and a target of level 4 or higher takes damage and is stunned, and so on). Action.<br>
