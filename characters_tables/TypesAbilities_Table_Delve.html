                <b>Bonus Pools Values:</b> You
                get 6 additional points to divide among your stat Pools however you wish.
                <br><br>
                <b>Effort:</b> Your
                Effort is 1.<br><br><b>Talented:</b> You have an Intellect Edge of 1, a Speed Edge of 1, and a Might
                Edge of 0.<br><br><b>Cypher Use:</b> You can bear two cyphers at a time.
                <br><br><b>Weapons:</b> You can
                use light and medium weapons without penalty. You have an inability with heavy weapons; your attacks
                with heavy weapons are hindered.
                <br><br><b>Skills:</b> You are trained in salvaging numenera. In
                addition, you are trained in an exploration skill in which you are not already trained. Choose from the
                following: navigation, perception, sensing danger, creature knowledge, initiative, peacefully opening
                communications with strangers, or tracking. You have an inability in crafting numenera and understanding
                numenera. Enabler.

                <i>Special:</i><br>
                <b>Familiarize:</b>You can familiarize yourself with a new area if you spend at least one hour studying
                a region up to a long distance across that you are able to directly access and move about in. Once
                you’ve familiarized yourself with an area, all your tasks related to perception, navigation, stealth,
                and moving about the area gain an asset. Each time you familiarize yourself with a new area, you lose
                focus on a previous area unless you spend 1 XP to retain the familiarity permanently. Action to
                initiate, one hour to complete.

                <br><br>
                <b>Starting Equipment:</b> You start with
                clothing, two weapons (or one weapon and a shield), light armor or 1 extra unit of responsive synth
                (your choice), a pack of light tools, an explorer’s pack, two cyphers (chosen by the GM), one oddity
                (chosen by the GM), and 3 shins (coins). If you start with a ranged weapon that requires ammunition
                (arrows, for example), you start with 12 of that type of ammunition. Before selecting your weapons,
                armor, and other gear, you might want to wait until after you’ve chosen your Delve lore, descriptor, and
                focus.
                <br><br><b>Community Explorer:</b> While you are present within a community, and
                actively and personally working on behalf of that community, the community’s effective rank for purposes
                of finding resources, locating new trade routes, knowing about conditions just beyond the community, and
                detecting sneak attacks by enemies is +1. Enabler.
                <br><br><b>Delve Lore:</b> You have special abilities called Delve lore that are related to
                exploring strange places and using numenera. Some of these abilities are constant, ongoing effects, and
                others are specific actions that usually cost points from one of your stat Pools.<br>Choose two of the
                lores described below. You can’t choose the same lore more than once unless its description says
                otherwise. You can keep track of these in the Special Abilities section of your character
                sheet.<br><br><b>Delve Player Intrusions:</b> you can spend 1 XP to use one of the following player
                intrusions, provided the situation is appropriate and the GM agrees.<br><b>- Fortuitous Malfunction:</b>
                a trap or a dangerous device malfunctions before it can affect you.<br><b>- Serendipitous Landmark:</b>
                just when it seems like the path is lost, or you are, a trail marker, landmark, or simply the way the
                terrain or corridor bends, rises, or falls away suggests to you the best path forward, at least from
                this point.<br><b>- Weak Strain:</b> the poison or disease turns out not to be as debilitating or deadly
                as it first seemed, and inflicts only half the damage that it would have otherwise.<br>
            </td>
            <td>
                <b>Iotum Cache:</b> Whenever you find or salvage iotum, you gain additional salvage attempt to get iotum
                of specific kind. Enabler.
                <br><br>
                <b>Delve Lore:</b> Choose one of the following lores (or a lore from a lower tier) to add to your
                repertoire. In addition, you can replace one of your first-tier lores with a different first-tier
                lore.<br>
            </td>
            <td><b>Expert Cypher Use:</b> You can bear three cyphers at a time.

                <br><br><b>Skill With Attacks:</b> Choose one type of attack in which you are not already trained: light
                bashing, light bladed, light ranged, medium bashing, medium bladed, medium ranged, heavy bashing, heavy
                bladed, or heavy ranged. You are trained in attacks using that type of weapon. You can select this
                ability multiple times. Each time you select it, you must choose a different type of attack.
                Enabler.
                <br><br><b>Improved Community Explorer:</b> A community continues to modify its rank by +1 on any task
                that involves finding
                resources, locating new trade routes, knowing about conditions just beyond the community, and detecting
                sneak attacks by enemies. However, you do not need to be constantly present in and actively working on
                behalf of the community for it to gain this benefit; it gains it merely because of your past efforts in
                the community. Enabler.
                <br><br><b>Delve Lore:</b> Choose one of the following lores (or a lore from a
                lower tier) to add to your repertoire. In addition, you can replace one of your lower-tier lores with a
                different lower-tier lore.<br>

                skill. If you choose a skill you’re already trained in, you become specialized in that skill.

                discover iotum on an initial salvage task, your follow-up attempts to locate a specific variety of iotum
                gain one free level of Effort if you use at least one level of Effort (maximum six levels).

                move a long distance as your entire action for a turn. If you apply a level of Effort to this ability,
                you can move a long distance and make an attack as your entire action for a turn, but the attack is
                hindered. Enabler.<br>

            <td><b>Skill With Defense:</b> Choose one type of defense task in which you are not already trained: Might,
                Speed, or Intellect. You are trained in defense tasks of that type. You can select this lore up to three
                times. Each time you select it, you must choose a different type of defense task. Enabler.<br>
            </td>
            <td><b>Experienced With Armor:</b> The cost reduction from your Trained in Armor ability improves. You now
                reduce the Speed Effort cost for wearing armor by an additional 1. Enabler.
            </td>
            <td><b>Counter Danger (4 Intellect points):</b> You negate a source of potential danger related to one
                creature or object within immediate distance for one minute (instead of one round, as with Foil Danger).
                This could be a weapon or device held by someone, a creature’s natural ability, or a trap triggered by a
                pressure plate. You can also try to counter an action (like moving or making a conventional, mundane
                attack with a weapon, a claw, etc.). Action.<br>
            </td>
            <td><b>Concussion (3 Intellect points + iotum):</b> If you have at least 1 unit of iotum, you can fashion a
                concussive device. The adapted iotum can explode with concussive force, either after being tossed up to
                a long distance or on a short timer, whichever you prefer. The explosion deals damage equal to iotum
                level to everything within short range. Even if you fail the attack roll, targets in the area take 1
                point of ambient damage. Once fashioned, the adapted iotum lasts for about a minute or until detonated.
                This use destroys the iotum. Action to tinker with the iotum; action to initiate.<br>
            </td>
            <td><b>Inspire Coordinated Actions (9 Intellect points):</b> If your allies can see and easily understand
                you, you can instruct each of them to take one specific action (the same action for all of them). If any
                of them choose to take that exact action, they can do so as an additional action immediately. This
                doesn’t interfere with them taking their normal actions on their turns. Action.<br>

                Enabler.<br>

            <td><b>Danger Instinct (3 Speed points):</b> If you are attacked by surprise, whether by a creature, a
                device, or simply an environmental hazard (a tree falling on you), you can move an immediate distance
                before the attack occurs. If moving prevents the attack, you are safe. If the attack can still
                potentially affect you—if the attacking creature can move to keep pace, if the attack fills an area too
                big to escape, etc.— the ability offers no benefit. Enabler.<br>
            </td>
            <td><b>Device Insight (3 Intellect points):</b> When examining any numenera device, you gain an idea of its
                capabilities or of how it functions, how it can be activated or deactivated, what its weakness is, how
                it can be repaired, or any other similar query— the type of information is specified by you.
                Essentially, each time you use this ability, you can ask the GM one question about a device. When you
                use Device Insight, “The answer is beyond your comprehension" is a fair response from the GM. Sometimes
                information gained is of no use because of its alien or incomprehensible nature, or its utter lack of
                context. This is for difficult or strange things beyond those readily identified by using the numenera
                skill. Action.<br>
            </td>
            <td><b>Seize Opportunity (4 Speed points):</b> If you succeed on a Speed defense roll to resist an attack,
                you gain an action, but the action is hindered. You can use your hindered action immediately even if you
                have already taken a turn in the round. Using this ability doesn’t prevent you from taking your normal
                action this round. Enabler.<br>
            </td>
            <td><b>Free to Move:</b> You ignore all movement penalties and adjustments due to terrain or other
                obstacles. You can fit through any space large enough to fit your head. Tasks involving breaking free of
                bonds, a creature’s grip, or any similar impediment gain three free levels of Effort. Enabler.<br>
            </td>
            <td><b>Mastery With Attacks:</b> Choose one type of attack in which you are trained: light bashing, light
                bladed, light ranged, medium bashing, medium bladed, medium ranged, heavy bashing, heavy bladed, or
                heavy ranged. You are specialized in attacks using that type of weapon. Enabler. (If you aren’t trained
                in an attack, select Skill With Attacks to become trained in that attack.)<br>

                feets). Enabler.<br>
            </td>

            <td><b>Environmental Adaptation (2+ Intellect points):</b> You use your wits and some learned tricks to
                survive a hostile environment. You can breathe safely in smoke or poison gas or survive temperature
                extremes for up to ten hours. In certain instances, the GM might require simple materials. In extreme
                cases, such as crushing gravity or burning lava, this ability lasts for about a minute, requires io and
                intellect points equal to the damage level of danger, split evenly between them. You can protect other
                creatures in addition to yourself, but each additional creature costs you the same number of io and
                Intellect points as it costs to protect you. It never protects against quick, instantaneous threats,
                like an attack with a weapon or a sudden explosion of fire. Action to initiate, one minute to
                prepare.<br>
            </td>
            <td><b>Follower:</b> You gain a level 2 follower. One of their modifications must be for salvaging numenera,
                navigation, perception, sensing danger, initiative, or tracking. You can take this ability multiple
                times, each time gaining another level 2 follower. The GM may require that you actually look for a
                suitable follower— as opposed to merely gaining one—as a long-term task. Enabler.<br>
            </td>
            <td><b>Experienced Finder (6+ Intellect points):</b> When you are looking for something specific, such as a
                particular kind of iotum, a chemical needed to complete a vaccine for a disease, a spare part required
                to repair a damaged device, the tracks of a specific beast, or the sword that a thief stole from you,
                this ability is of great use. <br>For the next 28 hours, if you come within short range of the thing and
                circumstances are such that it is possible for you to perceive the thing (for example, it’s not in a
                locked chamber for which you do not have the key), you find it. This ability assumes that you are
                constantly on the lookout, always looking everywhere possible, peering behind obstacles, and so on—if
                you’re running for your life, sleeping, or otherwise occupied, this ability does not help you.
                <br><br>
                You use this ability in lieu of making a roll to find the thing, but only if the difficulty for
                finding the object is level 6 or below. You can apply Effort to increase the maximum level of the thing
                you’re trying to find (each level of Effort used this way increases the maximum level by 1).

            <td><b>Negate Danger (7 Intellect points):</b> You permanently negate a source of potential danger related
                to one creature or object within immediate distance. This could be a weapon or device held by someone, a
                creature’s natural ability, or a trap triggered by a pressure plate. Action.<br>

                debilitated until you rest for ten hours. If you die again before you take your ten-hour recovery roll,

            <td><b>Foil Danger (2 Intellect points):</b> You can attempt a task to negate one source of potential danger
                related to one creature or object that you are aware of within immediate distance for one round. This
                could be a weapon or device held by someone, a trap triggered by a pressure plate, or a creature’s
                natural ability (something special, innate, and dangerous, like an ithsyn’s gas spray or a cragworm’s
                venom). You can also try to foil a foe's mundane action (such as an attack), so that the action isn't
                made this round. Action.
                <br>
                Additional Info: Delves who want to make the most of their Foil Danger special ability will want to be
                trained in some kind of creature knowledge to ease tasks related to those creatures. Using Foil Danger
                to suppress a natural ability can be described as being clever with a mundane action. An ithsyn’s gas
                might be suppressed by the Delve’s use of a leather bag to block it. A Delve might suppress a cragworm’s
