                of 0.<br><br><b>Combat Prowess:</b> You add +1 damage to one type of attack of your choice: melee
                attacks or ranged attacks. Enabler.<br><br><b>Cypher Use:</b> You can bear two cyphers at a
                time.<br><br><b>Trained in Armor:</b> You can wear armor for long periods of time without tiring and can
                compensate for slowed reactions from wearing armor. You reduce the Speed Effort cost for wearing armor
                by 1. Enabler.<br><br><b>Weapons:</b> You can use any weapon without penalty.<br><br><b>Physical
                    Skills:</b> Choose one of the following skills in which you aren’t already trained: balancing,
                climbing, jumping, or swimming. You are trained in this skill. You have an inability in crafting
                numenera, salvaging numenera, and understanding numenera.<br><br><b>Starting Equipment:</b> You start
                with clothing, two weapons (or one weapon and a shield), light or medium armor, an explorer’s pack, two
                cyphers (chosen for you by the GM), one oddity (chosen for you by the GM), and 5 shins (coins). If you
                start with a ranged weapon that requires ammunition (arrows, for example), you start with 12 of that
                type of ammunition. Before selecting your weapons, armor, and other gear, you might want to wait until
                after you’ve chosen your fighting moves, descriptor, and focus.<br><br><b>Community Defender:</b> While
                you are present within a community, and actively and personally working on behalf of that community, the
                community’s effective rank for damage inflicted is +1. Enabler. <br><br><b>Fighting Moves:</b> You have
                a special talent for combat and can perform feats that others can barely imagine. These feats are called
                fighting moves. Some fighting moves are constant, ongoing effects, and others are specific actions that
                usually cost points from one of your stat Pools.<br>Choose two of the fighting moves described below.
                You can’t choose the same fighting move more than once unless its description says
                otherwise.<br><br><b>Player Intrusions:</b> you can spend 1XP to use one of the following player
                intrusions, provided the situation is appropriate and the GM agrees. <br><b>- Perfect Setup:</b> you’re
                fighting at least three foes and each one is standing in exactly the right spot for you to use a move
                you trained in long ago, allowing you to attack all three as a single action. Make a separate attack
                roll for each foe. You remain limited by the amount of Effort you can apply on one action. <br><b>- Old
                    Friend:</b> a comrade in arms from your past shows up unexpectedly and provides aid in whatever
                you’re doing. They are on a mission of their own and can’t stay longer than it takes to help out, chat a
                while after, and perhaps share a quick meal. <br><b>- Weapon Break:</b> your foe’s weapon has a weak
                spot and in the course of the combat quickly becomes damaged and moves two steps down the object damage
                track.<br>

                community continues to modify its effective rank for damage inflicted by +1. However, you do not need to
                be constantly present in and actively working on behalf of the community for it to gain this benefit; it
                gains it merely because of your past defense of the community. Enabler. <br><br><b>Fighting Moves:</b>
                Choose one of the following fighting moves (or a move from a lower tier) to add to your repertoire. In

                You can take community actions with a horde or a community as if you were a rank 3 rampaging beast horde
                for one hour. You can spend a few rounds or minutes here and there taking character actions if something
                requires attention and still retain your horde status. For each allied PC that joins you and remains
                with you during this period who also spends 12 points from one of their Pools, you can extend the
                duration by one hour. Each point of damage you take while being treated as a rampaging beast horde is
                deducted from your Might Pool, or if you have allied PCs helping, the damage is split up and deducted
                from all your Might Pools evenly. Action to initiate. <br><b>- Recruit Deputy:</b> You gain a level 4

                move a long distance as your entire action for a turn. If you apply a level of Effort to this ability,
                you can move a long distance and make an attack as your entire action for a turn, but the attack is
                hindered. Enabler.<br>

            <td><b>Skill With Defense:</b> Choose one type of defense task in which you are not already trained: Might,
                Speed, or Intellect. You are trained in defense tasks of that type. Unlike most fighting moves, you can
                select this move up to three times. Each time you select it, you must choose a different type of defense
                task. Enabler.<br>
            </td>
            <td><b>Lunge (2 Might points):</b> This move requires you to extend yourself for a powerful stab or smash.
                The awkward lunge hinders the attack roll. If your attack is successful, it inflicts 4 additional points
                of damage. Action.<br>

            <td><b>Hemorrhage (2+ Might points):</b> You make a powerful and precise strike that inflicts additional
                damage later. On your next turn, the target of this attack takes an additional 3 points of damage (this
                ignores Armor). The target can prevent this additional damage by making a recovery roll, using any
                ability that heals it, or using its action to attend to the injury. In addition to the normal options
                for using Effort, you can choose to use Effort to increase this duration by one round. Action.<br>
            </td>
            <td><b>Obstacle Running (3 Speed points):</b> For the next minute, you can ignore obstacles that slow your
                movement, allowing you to travel at normal speed through areas with rubble, fences, tables, and similar
                objects that you would have to climb over or move around. This movement might include sliding on a
                railing, briefly running along a wall, or even stepping on a creature to boost yourself over something.
                If an obstacle would normally require a Might or Speed task to overcome, such as swinging on a rope,
                balancing on a rope, or jumping over a hole, you are trained at that task. Enabler.<br>

                targets (all next to one another) at once. Make a separate attack roll against each target. Each attack

                damage than normal. Action.<br>

            <td><b>Battlefield Tactician (2+ Intellect points):</b> You scrutinize your surroundings, learning whatever
                facts the GM feels are pertinent about attacking, defending, maneuvering, and dealing with environmental
                hazards within a short distance. For example, you might notice a pile of rubble you can stand on for an
                advantage in melee, a sheltered corner to help protect against enemy attacks, a less-slippery part of a
                frozen lake, or a place where the poison gas is thinner than elsewhere. If you (or someone you tell)
                move to that location, you (or the person told) gain an asset on tasks related to that optimal position
                (such as attack rolls from the high ground, Speed defense rolls from the sheltered corner, balance rolls
                on the frozen lake, or Might defense rolls against the poisonous cloud). Instead of gaining an
                advantageous location, you might learn a disadvantageous location that you could use against your
                enemies, such as maneuvering them into an awkward corner that hinders their melee attacks or a weak spot
                on the frozen lake that will break if they stand on it. You can apply Effort to learn one additional
                good or bad location within range (one location per level of Effort), increase the range of this ability
                (another short distance per level of Effort), or both. Enabler.<br>

            <td><b>Slayer (3 Might points):</b> When you successfully strike an NPC or creature of level 5 or lower,
                make another roll (using whichever stat you used to attack). If you succeed on the second roll, you kill
                the target outright. If you use this fighting move against a PC of any tier and you succeed on the
                second roll, the character moves down one step on the damage track. Enabler.<br>

                attack on that same turn against a new foe within your reach. The second attack is part of the same

            <td><b>Minor to Major:</b> You treat rolls of natural 19 as rolls of natural 20 for Might attack rolls or
                Speed attack rolls (your choice when you gain this ability). This allows you to gain a major effect on a
                natural 19 or 20. Enabler.<br>

            <td><b>Jump Attack (5 Might points):</b> You attempt a difficulty 4 Might roll to jump high into the air as
                part of your melee attack action. If you succeed at the jump and your attack hits, you inflict 3
                additional points of damage and knock the foe prone. If you fail at the jump, you still make your normal
                attack roll, but you don’t inflict the extra damage or knock down the opponent if you hit. In addition
                to the normal options for using Effort, you can choose to use Effort to enhance your jump; each level of
                Effort used in this way adds +2 feet to the height and +1 damage to the attack. Action.<br>

                ranged). Make a separate attack roll for each foe. You remain limited by the amount of Effort you can
                apply on one action. Anything that modifies your attack or damage applies to all of these attacks. In
                addition to the normal options for using Effort, you can choose to use Effort to increase the number of
                foes you can attack with this ability (one additional foe per level of Effort used in this way).

                weapon, if it has less than the number rolled). You are trained in making this attack. If the attack is

                of damage, you deal 3 extra points instead. If you roll a natural 20 and choose to deal damage instead
