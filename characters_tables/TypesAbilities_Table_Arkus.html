                get 6 additional points to divide among your stat Pools however you wish.<br><br><b>Effort:</b> Your
                Effort is 1.<br><br><b>Leader:</b> You have an Intellect Edge of 1, a Might Edge of 0, and a Speed Edge
                of 0.<br><br><b>Cypher Use:</b> You can bear two cyphers at a time.<br><br><b>Weapons:</b> You can use
                light weapons without penalty. You have an inability with medium and heavy weapons; your attacks with
                medium and heavy weapons are hindered.<br><br><b>Interaction Skills:</b> You are trained in two skills
                in which you are not already trained. Choose two of the following: persuasion, negotiation, deceiving,
                public speaking, seeing through deception, or intimidating. You have an inability in crafting numenera,
                salvaging numenera, and understanding numenera. Enabler.<br><br><b>Community Leader:</b> While you are
                present within a community, and actively and personally working on behalf of that community, the
                community’s rank is +1 for all purposes except damage inflicted. Enabler.<br><b>Starting Equipment:</b>
                You start with stylish clothing and a light weapon of your choice, two cyphers (chosen by the GM), one
                oddity, and 9 shins. If you start with a ranged weapon that requires ammunition (arrows, for example),
                you start with 12 of that type of ammunition. Before choosing your weapon and other gear, you might want
                to wait until after you’ve chosen your precepts, descriptor, and focus.<br><br><b>Precepts:</b> You have
                a wide range of abilities that give you an edge over other people. Some of these precepts are similar to
                esoteries in that you call upon a strange ability, use a device, and so on. Others are more mundane,
                relying on skill. Almost all require that you can speak to use them. Unless otherwise described, if they
                affect another creature, that creature must be able to perceive and understand you. Some precepts are
                constant, ongoing effects; others are specific actions that usually cost points from one of your stat
                Pools.<br>Choose two of the precepts described below. You can’t choose the same precept more than once
                unless its description says otherwise. You can keep track of these in the Special Abilities section of
                your character sheet.<br><br><b>Arkus Player Intrusions:</b> you can spend 1 XP to use one of the
                following player intrusions,<br>provided the situation is appropriate and the GM agrees.<br><b>-
                    Friendly NPC:</b> an NPC you don’t know, someone you don’t know that well, or someone you know but
                who hasn’t been particularly friendly in the past chooses to help you, though doesn’t necessarily
                explain why. Maybe they’ll ask you for a favor in return afterward, depending on how much trouble they
                go to.<br><b>- Perfect Suggestion:</b> a follower or other already-friendly NPC suggests a course of
                action with regard to an urgent question, problem, or obstacle you’re facing.<br><b>- Unexpected
                    Gift:</b> an NPC hands you a physical gift you were not expecting, one that helps put the situation
                at ease if things seem strained, or provides you with a new insight for understanding the context of the
                situation if there’s something you’re failing to understand or grasp.<br>

                A community continues to modify its effective rank by +1 for any task except for attack and defense.
                However, you do not need to be constantly present in and actively working on behalf of the community for
                it to gain this benefit; it gains it merely because of your past work in the community.

                bond together by entertaining them with an uplifting or pointed anecdote. For the next hour, those who
                pay attention to your story are trained in a task you choose that’s related to the anecdote, as long as
                it’s not an attack or defense task. Action to initiate, one minute to complete.<br>
            </td>
            <td><b>Inspire Action (4 Intellect points):</b> If one ally can see and easily understand you, you can
                instruct that ally to take an action. If the ally chooses to take that exact action, they can do so as
                an additional action immediately. Doing so doesn’t interfere with the ally taking a normal action on
                their turn. If you have both Inspire Action and a focus ability that also grants an ally an extra
                action, then you can apply a level of Effort when using Inspire Action to simultaneously inspire two
                allies to take the same action. Action.<br>
            </td>
            <td><b>Improved Follower:</b> You gain a level 3 follower. They are not restricted on their modifications.
                Alternatively, you can choose to advance a level 2 follower you already have to level 3 and then gain a
                new level 2 follower. Enabler.<br>
            </td>
            <td><b>False Group Identity (2 Intellect points):</b> If you and group of up to ten creatures have some kind
                of physical disguise you can fool a sentient creature that you are someone else. You gain a free level
                of Effort on this task. Enabler.<br>
            </td>
            <td><b>Flee (6 Intellect points):</b> All non-allies within short distance who can hear your dreadful,
                intimidating words flee from you at top speed for one minute.<br>
            </td>
            <td><b>Battle Management (4 Intellect points):</b> As long as you spend your action each round giving orders
                or advice, the difficulty of attack and defense actions by your allies within short range is decreased
                by one step. Action to initiate. Action to maintain.<br>

                Enabler.<br>
            </td>
            <td><b>Skill With Defense:</b> Choose one type of defense task in which you are not already trained: Might,
                Speed, or Intellect. You are trained in defense tasks of that type. You can select this precept up to
                three times. Each time you select it, you must choose a different type of defense task. Enabler.<br>
            </td>
            <td><b>Rally (4+ Intellect points):</b> Your words imbue the spirit of a character within immediate range
                who is able to understand you, accelerating her so that she gains an asset on initiative tasks and Speed
                defense rolls for one minute. Instead of applying Effort to decrease the difficulty, you can use it to
                affect more targets; each level of Effort affects one additional target. You must speak to additional
                targets to accelerate them, one target per round. Action per target to initiate.<br>
            </td>
            <td><b>Anticipate Attack (4 Intellect points):</b> You can sense when and how creatures attacking you will
                make their attacks. The difficulty of Speed defense rolls is reduced by one step for one minute.
                Action.<br>
            </td>
            <td><b>Dangerous Group Insight (5 Intellect points):</b> If you interact with or study a group of sentient
                creatures (all of which must be in short range) for at least a round, you gain an advantage over them in
                combat, having spotted a weakness or devised a viable tactic. You gain an asset on attack rolls made
                against any of those creatures for 28 hours. What's more, if you use an action speaking with an ally
                about the group, that ally then gets the same asset. You can speak to one ally per action. Action.<br>
            </td>
            <td><b>Sway Horde (12+ Intellect points):</b> You can attempt to sway a horde of up to rank 2 to disperse or
                attack a community other than the one it is currently targeting, or you can try to raise a horde from a
                village or larger community that contains enough ablebodied adults. If you succeed at raising a horde,
                its level is equal to the rank of the community it comes from, and the horde remains cohesive for up to
                three days or until it is destroyed. In addition to the normal options for using Effort, you can also
                choose to use Effort to increase the rank of the horde you sway by 1 for each level of Effort applied.
                Action to initiate, one hour to complete.<br>

            <td><b>Connection With an Organization:</b> You have a general connection with an important organization,
                such as the Order of Truth, the Angulan Knights, the aristocracy of a region, a merchant guild, and so
                on. Tasks related to interacting with members of that group gain an asset. Further, you can use this
                connection to get help, lower prices on goods, learn about something related or whatever is appropriate.
                You and the GM should work out the details together. You can choose this ability more than once and
                choose a new organization each time. Enabler.<br>
            </td>
            <td><b>Disincentivize (4 Intellect point):</b> You hinder all actions attempted by any number of targets
                within short range who can understand you. You choose which targets are affected. Affected targets’
                actions are hindered for one round. Arkai who use Disincentivize typically promise, lie, or threaten in
                order to hinder actions. Action.<br>
            </td>
            <td><b>Blend In (4 Intellect points):</b> When you blend in, creatures still see you, but they attach no
                importance to your presence for about a minute. While blending in, you are specialized in stealth and
                Speed defense tasks. This effect ends if you do something to reveal your presence or position—
                attacking, using an ability, moving a large object, and so on. If this occurs, you can regain the
                remaining period of effect by taking an action to focus on seeming innocuous and as if you belong.
                Action to initiate or reinitiate.<br>
            </td>
            <td><b>Psychosis (4 Intellect points):</b> Your words inflict a destructive psychosis in the mind of a
                target within long range that can understand you, dealing 6 points of Intellect damage (ignores Armor)
                per round. The psychosis can be dispersed if a target spends an action doing nothing but calming and
                centering itself. Action to initiate.<br>
            </td>
            <td><b>Healing Power of Words (6 Intellect points):</b> If you interact with or study a target for at least
                a round, you can attempt to restore points to the target’s Might Pool or Speed Pool in one of two ways:
                either the chosen Pool regains up to 6 points or it is restored to a total value of 12 (you choose when
                you initiate this ability). The attempt is a level 3 task. Points are restored at a rate of 1 point each
                round. You must continue speaking with the target the whole time. In no case can this ability raise a
                Pool higher than its normal maximum. Action to prepare; action to initiate. If the target spends points
                from their Pool during the ongoing healing, the healing ends.<br>
            </td>
            <td><b>Extra Community Action (9 Intellect points):</b> During the course of a conflict between communities,
                you can fire up one community so much that it can take two community actions in the same amount of time
                it could normally take only one. This means the community could inflict damage twice, inflict damage
                while another segment of the community tries to persuade some other neutral community or horde to become
                allied, or something else. This is considered a community task. Action to initiate, one hour to
                complete.<br>

            <td><b>Aggression (2 Intellect points):</b> Your words twist the mind of a character within short range who
                is able to understand you, unlocking her more primitive instincts. As a result, she gains an asset on
                her Might-based attack rolls for one minute. Action to initiate.<br>
            </td>
            <td><b>Follower:</b> You gain a level 2 follower. One of their modifications must be persuasion. You can
                take this ability multiple times, each time gaining another level 2 follower. The GM may require that
                you actually look for a suitable follower, as opposed to just gaining one, as a long-term task.
                Enabler.<br>
            </td>
            <td><b>Discerning Mind:</b> You have +3 to Armor against damaging attacks and damaging effects that target
                your mind and Intellect. The difficulty of defense rolls you make against attacks that attempt to
                confuse, persuade, frighten, or otherwise influence you is eased. Enabler.<br>
            </td>
            <td><b>Spur Effort (5 Intellect points):</b> You select an ally within immediate range. If that character
                applies Effort to a task on their next turn, they can apply a free level of Effort on that task.
                Action.<br>
            </td>
            <td><b>Skill With Attacks:</b> Choose one type of attack in which you are not already trained: light
                bashing, light bladed, light ranged, medium bashing, medium bladed, medium ranged, heavy bashing, heavy
                bladed, or heavy ranged. You are trained in attacks using that type of weapon. Enabler.<br>
            </td>
            <td><b>Inspiration (9 Intellect points):</b> You speak words of encouragement and inspiration. All allies
                within short range who can hear you immediately gain a recovery roll, gain an immediate free action, and
                have an asset for that free action. The recovery roll does not count as one of their normal recovery
                rolls. You can do this only once, but its use is restored each time you make a recovery roll.

            <td><b>Erase Memories (3 Intellect points):</b> You reach into the mind of a creature within immediate range
                and make an Intellect roll. On a success, you erase up to the last five minutes of its memory.
                Action.<br>
            </td>
            <td><b>Babel:</b> After hearing a language spoken for a few minutes, you can speak it and make yourself
                understood. If you continue to use the language to interact with native speakers, your skills improve
                rapidly, to the point where you might be mistaken for a native speaker after just a few hours of
                speaking the new language. Enabler.<br>
            </td>
            <td><b>Mind Reading (4 Intellect points):</b> You can read the surface thoughts of a creature within short
                range, even if it doesn't want you to. You must be able to see the target. Once you have established
                contact, you can read the target's thoughts for up to one minute. If you or the target moves out of
                range, the connection is broken. Action to initiate.<br>
            </td>
            <td><b>Strategize (6 Intellect points):</b> Having an action plan in place before facing a challenge
                improves the odds of success, even if that plan is eventually changed or discarded once it’s put into
                play. If you and your allies spend at least ten minutes going over a plan of action, all of you gain one
                free level of Effort that can be applied to one task you attempt during the execution of that plan
                within the next 28 hours. The plan of action must be something concrete and executable in order to gain
                this benefit. Action to initiate, ten minutes to complete.<br>
            </td>
            <td><b>Divide and Conquer (7 Intellect points):</b> If you brief and prep one of your followers or deputies
                for at least a round, they can act on your behalf within an allied community or horde so well that you
                can effectively take on two tasks simultaneously, whether they’re regular actions or community tasks. If
                taking regular actions, you can take two actions on each of your turns for up to one minute, including
                using special abilities of up to tier 3, even in two different parts of the community or horde. Special
                abilities used by your follower or deputy are subtracted from your Pools because they are acting on your
                direct authority and are relying on your influence. Alternatively, you can take normal actions while
                your prepped follower attempts a community task, or you can both attempt community tasks. Action to
                prepare; action to initiate.<br>
            </td>

                ally within immediate range gains +1 Edge to one stat of their choice for one hour. You also gain this
                benefit to one stat of your choice. Action.<br>

                if the creature can't understand you. For as long as you do nothing but speak (you can't even move), the
                other creature takes no actions other than to defend itself, even over multiple rounds. If the creature

                reasonable action must be agreed upon by the GM; it should not put the creatures or their allies in

                yourself with an aura of doom, fear, and doubt for one day. Creatures that can hear and understand you
                feel an urge to move at least a short distance away from the object. If a creature does not move away,
                the difficulty of all tasks, attacks, and defenses it attempts while within the aura is increased by one
                step. The duration of the aura is extended by one day per level of Effort applied. The aura is

                with you, your allies can apply a free level of Effort to any initiative tasks they attempt. This
                benefit is ongoing while you remain in the allies’ company. It ends if you leave, but it resumes if you
                return to the allies’ company within 28 hours. If you leave the allies’ company for more than 28 hours,
                you must spend another 28 hours together to reactivate the benefit. You must spend the Intellect point
                cost each 28 hours you wish to keep the benefit active. Enabler.<br>

                intelligent level 2 target within short range that can understand you. They destroy tissue, memories,
                and personality, triggering a vegetative state. Instead of applying Effort to decrease the difficulty of
                the attack, you can apply Effort to increase the maximum level of the target. Thus, to shatter the mind
                of a level 5 target (four levels above the normal limit), you must apply four levels of Effort.

                should be seen, not heard,” and so on. An ideal influences a creature's behavior but doesn't control it.
                The imparted ideal lasts for as long as befits the situation, but usually at least a few hours. The
                implanted ideal is jeopardized if someone friendly to the creature spends a minute or more bringing the

                obviously dangerous) or committing violence against someone or something they love. You could convince
