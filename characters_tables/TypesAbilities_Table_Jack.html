                which you will concentrate. For the rest of that day, you’re trained in that task. You can’t use this
                ability with a skill you’re already trained in to become

                of light tools, two cyphers (chosen for you by the GM), one oddity (chosen by the GM), and 8 shins.
                Before selecting your weapons, armor, and other gear, you might want to wait until

                <b>Tricks of the Trade:</b> You have a wide range of abilities that keep people
                guessing. Some of these tricks of the trade are technically esoteries, using the numenera, while others
                are more mundane. Some tricks are constant, ongoing effects; others are specific actions that usually
                cost points from one of your stat Pools.<br>Choose two of the tricks described below. You can’t choose
                the same trick more than once unless its description says otherwise.

                <b>Jack Player
                    Intrusions:</b> you can spend 1 XP to use one of the following player intrusions, provided the
                situation is appropriate and the GM agrees.<br><b>- Familiar Insight:</b> you know this person (or heard
                about them somewhere) well enough to give insight about their motives or intentions and how best to
                convince them to see things your way. You know the right words, posturing, inflection, amount of
                emotional manipulation, or even what sort of joke or agreeable complaint might sway them. This can
                convince a neutral person to take your side, or a hostile one to hear you out for a little while
                longer.<br><b>- Inspirational Recall:</b> you recall an important detail from a previous encounter
                (perhaps something you don’t even remember noticing at the time) that suggests a successful course of
                action for your current situation. This might be recognizing a password hidden in an innocuous code or
                riddle, realizing you saw a suspicious individual near a crime scene, overhearing an important
                conversation between two NPCs, or understanding that an NPC’s subtle glance or gesture had additional
                connotations indicating what you should do.<br><b>- Lucky Break:</b> something unexpected happens that
                is to your advantage. A rope your opponent is hanging from might snap, the person you’re debating in
                front of an influential Aeon Priest might trip or forget what they were going to say, or something that
                was supposed to last only a round or two lasts a little while longer.<br>

                move a long distance as your entire action for a turn. If you apply a level of Effort to this ability,
                you can move a long distance and make an attack as your entire action for a turn, but the attack is
                hindered. Enabler.<br>

            <td><b>Skill With Defense:</b> Choose one type of defense task in which you are not already trained: Might,
                Speed, or Intellect. You are trained in defense tasks of that type. Unlike most tricks of the trade, you
                can select this trick up to three times. Each time you select it, you must choose a different type of
                defense task. Enabler.<br>

                bashing, light bladed, light ranged, medium bashing, medium bladed, medium ranged, heavy bashing, heavy
                bladed, or heavy ranged. You are trained in attacks using that type of weapon. Enabler.<br>
            </td>
            <td><b>Bypass Barrier (6+ Intellect points):</b> You get past a door, force field, or other barrier up to 3
                feet (1 m) thick that is blocking your way. Depending on the barrier, this might involve finding a weak
                spot you can push through, luckily pressing the right button, or even weirder explanations like touching
                a thin place between dimensions or an unexpected interaction with numenera you carry. The difficulty of
                the task is the level of the barrier. This trick allows you alone to pass through, not anyone else, and
                the way through closes at the end of your turn (which might mean you’re trapped on the far side). You
                have an asset in any attempts to get through it again. In addition to the normal options for using
                Effort, you can choose to use Effort to increase the maximum thickness of the barrier, each level adding
                3 feet (1 m). Action.<br>
            </td>
            <td><b>Effective Skill:</b> Choose one non-combat skill when you gain this ability. You get a minor effect
                with that skill when you roll a natural 14 or higher (the d20 shows “14” or more). You get a major
                effect with that skill when you roll a natural 19 or higher (the d20 shows “19” or higher). Unlike most
                tricks of the trade, you can select this trick more than once. Each time you select it, you must choose
                a different non-combat skill. Enabler.<br>
            </td>
            <td><b>Blurring Speed (7 Speed points):</b> You move so quickly that until your next turn, you look like a
                blur. While you are blurred, if you apply Effort to a melee attack task or Speed defense task, you get a
                free level of Effort on that task; you can move a short distance as part of another action or a long
                distance as your entire action. Enabler.<br>

            <td><b>Trained in Armor:</b> You can wear armor for long periods of time without tiring and can compensate
                for slowed reactions from wearing armor. You can wear any kind of armor. You reduce the Speed Effort
                cost for wearing armor by 1. Enabler.<br>
            </td>
            <td><b>Create Debilitating Poison (3+ Intellect points):</b> You create one dose of a level 2 poison that
                hinders the poisoned creature’s actions for ten minutes. You can apply this poison to a weapon, food, or
                drink as part of the action of creating it. In addition to the normal options for using Effort, you can
                choose to use Effort to increase the level of the poison; each level of Effort used in this way
                increases the poison level by 2. If unused, the poison loses its potency after one hour. Action.<br>
            </td>
            <td><b>Meticulous Planner:</b> If you spend a long time planning an action, you gain an asset on performing
                it. The time to study and plan for the action is ten times as long as it takes to perform the action.
                For example, if you want to jump across a hole in the floor (one action), you can study the area for ten
                rounds (about a minute), and when you attempt to jump over the hole, you have an asset on the jump. This
                benefit applies to only one roll—if you want to perform the task again with the benefit of an asset, you
                need to study and plan again. Enabler.<br>
            </td>
            <td><b>Crowd Control (6+ Intellect points):</b> You control the actions of up to five creatures in short
                range. This effect lasts for one minute. All targets must be level 2 or lower. Your control is limited
                to simple verbal commands like “stop,” “run away,” “follow that Glaive,” “look over there,” or “get out
                of my way.” All affected creatures respond to the command unless you specifically command them
                otherwise. In addition to the normal options for using Effort, you can choose to use Effort to increase
                the maximum level of the targets or affect an additional five people. Thus, to control a group that has
                a level 4 target (two levels above the normal limit) or a group of fifteen people, you must apply two
                levels of Effort. When the Crowd Control trick ends, the creatures remember your commands but don’t
                remember being controlled— your commands seemed reasonable at the time. Action to initiate.<br>
            </td>
            <td><b>Jaunt (5+ Intellect points):</b> You instantaneously teleport yourself to any location within a long
                distance that you can see. In addition to the normal options for using Effort, you can choose to use
                Effort to increase the distance you can travel; each level of Effort used in this way increases the
                range by another 100 feet (30 m). Action.<br>
            </td>
            <td><b>Doppeljack (7+ Might points):</b> A perfect copy of you appears within an immediate distance. This
                doppeljack might be a version ofyou from another timeline, a parallel dimension, or the past; an
                instantly spawned clone; or something even stranger. The doppeljack is a level 6 NPC with 18 health. It
                has your mind and memories, and you control it as if it were you in another body. In effect, while this
                ability is active, you have two bodies. If the doppeljack uses any of your abilities that cost points,
                those points come from your Pools (including spending Effort). Controlling two bodies at once is
                difficult and distracting; while this ability is active, all tasks performed by you or the doppeljack
                are hindered. The doppeljack has no equipment other than simple clothing. It remains for up to one
                minute, but disappears if killed or if you use an action to dismiss it. If the doppeljack is killed, you
                take 6 points of damage that ignore Armor, and you lose your next action. If you are killed while the
                doppeljack is present, you live on as the doppeljack (it becomes your character instead of being an NPC
                that disappears). In addition to the normal options for using Effort, you can choose to use Effort to
                increase the duration of this ability; each level of Effort used in this way adds one minute to the
                doppeljack’s existence. Action.<br>

                creature is no larger than a large cat (about 20 pounds, or 9 kg) and is normally some sort of
                domesticated species. You and the GM must work out the details of your creature, and you’ll probably
                make rolls for it in combat or when it takes actions. The critter companion acts on your turn. As a
                level 1 creature, it has a target number of 3 and a 3 health, and it inflicts 1 point of damage. Its
                movement is based on its creature type (avian, swimmer, and so on). If your critter companion dies, you
                can search an urban or wild environment for 1d6 days to find a new companion. Enabler.<br>

            <td><b>Obstacle Running (3 Speed points):</b> For the next minute, you can ignore obstacles that slow your
                movement, allowing you to travel at normal speed through areas with rubble, fences, tables, and similar
                objects that you would have to climb over or move around. This movement might include sliding on a
                railing, briefly running along a wall, or even stepping on a creature to boost yourself over something.
                If an obstacle would normally require a Might or Speed task to overcome, such as swinging on a rope,
                balancing on a rope, or jumping over a hole, you are trained at that task. Enabler.<br>

            <td><b>Illusory Evasion (5 Intellect points):</b> When you are hit by an attack, you teleport an immediate
                distance away, leaving behind an illusory copy of yourself to be struck by that attack instead of you.
                This destroys the illusion but leaves you unharmed by the attack. If the attack affects an area and the
                teleportation can’t get you out of that area, the attack still affects you normally. Enabler.<br>

                using this ability, “down” for you is either the surface you are walking on or the normal orientation of
                gravity (your choice). If you apply one level of Effort, you can also walk on the ceiling or on a liquid
                or semi-liquid surface such as water, mud, quicksand, or even lava (although touching a dangerous
                surface like lava still harms you). If you apply two levels of Effort, you can also walk on air as if it

                example, you could make it walk or attack), but it can’t move more than an short distance from where you
                created it. The illusion includes sound and smell. It lasts for ten minutes and changes as you direct

                understanding numenera roll (difficulty equal to the level of the cypher) to recharge it. Otherwise, the
                cypher remains spent and useless. Some cyphers (particularly pills and injections) cannot be recharged

                used within the past week, it must be third tier or lower, and it must be an ability with a point cost.
                In addition to the point cost of Memory Becomes Action, you must pay the Might, Speed, or Intellect cost
                of the ability you are copying. For example, if you want to copy a Glaive friend’s Lunge attack (which
                normally costs 2 Might points), you’d pay 4 Intellect points to activate Memory Becomes Action and 2
                Might points to use Lunge. In addition to the normal options for using Effort, you can choose to use
                Effort to copy an ability you saw longer than one week ago; each level of Effort used in this way

                creature for one round, causing it to lose its next turn. If you fail, you still make your normal attack

                other action by you, it instead seems to happen on its own. Instead of using your tools to pick a lock,
                the lock clicks open as you stand near it. Instead of manipulating a numenera screen, the information
                you want appears on the screen when you look at it. Instead of bluffing your way past some guards, they
                step aside as you approach and let you through. This ability usually only works up to an immediate
                distance. You still must spend points and make rolls to use your skills and tricks with this ability.

                vanish for a few seconds and reappear in the same place. While in this unreal state, you can use
                abilities or objects on yourself, but you can’t perceive, interact with, or affect the rest of the
                world, and vice versa. Time-based effects already on you (like a poison that inflicts damage every
