            </td>
            <td>
                You are tough to be around sometimes— your manner and your words are blunt, and even cruel. The fineries of polite society hold no value for you. Instead, you focus on practical things. Things that matter. What someone could accomplish with honeyed words in an hour, you can accomplish in a few moments with a crowbar.
                You appreciate straightforward action. You don't like to waste your time and if some idiot gets in your way, you'll not only point out their idiocy, you'll happily push right by. You're cynical, blunt, and sometimes rude. Who cares what people think?

                Adaptable
            </td>
            <td>
                You flex and sway with changes both physical and mental. When something bad happens to you, you feel the pain and the loss, but soon, you’re back on your feet and in the action. When you have to learn a new skill, you don’t back away, but instead, you jump in and try your best. Being adaptable means that you’re often cooperative, because you know that, by working together, a group can overcome things that might be impossible for an individual. Some seek you out because of your adaptability, but others don’t see it as a positive trait and instead see you as someone who always changes their mind—someone without a foundation. You laugh at those accusations. That’s just the sort of thing someone would say if they had never changed their mind about anything in their life—a way for that person to feel good about their lack of growth.

This includes tasks related to ending an ongoing condition such as being dazed, blinded, stunned, and so on. (However, you are not trained in tasks to resist effects that confer those conditions in the first place.)<br>

            <td>
                Action. Violence. These are your first instincts. Problems are solved through force. Strength is what matters, right?
                Let the others sit idly by, either through cowardice or indecision, but you'll get things done. Certainly no one would ever call you a coward, but you're not foolhardy. You've got a preservation instinct. But you know that the best defense is a good offense, and a dead or incapacitated foe is no threat to anyone.
                You're bold, you're quick, and some might say you're rash. A few might call you dangerous, but again, those are mostly cowards. Sometimes, even your allies and friends need a good shaking to show them what's what, and who's boss.

                Altruistic
            </td>
            <td>
                You try to do what's right for its own sake. You're very generous, and sincerely enjoy helping people. Some may attempt to take advantage of you for these traits, but most people find you likable and your actions laudable. You've learned that to help others, you need to be capable and skilled yourself. Wishing to help others is an excellent incentive to become as skilled and powerful as you can.
                Eventually, you're going to develop a bit of a reputation as a “do-gooder.” That doesn’t bother you, as long as fools don’t try to take advantage of you. After all, altruistic doesn’t mean stupid.
                Some people think that altruistic means foolish or gullible. It certainly doesn’t have to, just as cynical and selfish doesn’t always mean wise.

            </td>
            <td>
                You are funny, charming, and extremely likable. You make your friends laugh, and even defuse dangerous situations with your humor.
                There’s nothing that puts people at ease like a good joke. Maybe you’re good at pointing out the faults of others without making them feel bad. Maybe your humor is self-deprecating. Maybe it’s all physical, with you doing funny things with your face, balancing things on your head, or wearing funny clothes. Humor comes in many forms.
                Some people might tend to underestimate you, thinking you a fool because sometimes you pretend to be foolish. That's their problem.

            <td>
                When you speak, people understand exactly what you’re saying. You’re fluent, coherent, and, some might even say, silver-tongued, though you’d beg to differ. You don’t manipulate people; you just explain things so clearly and with such imaginative examples that those who disagree with you often come around to your point of view. Your eloquence is something that many praise you for, though some hate you for it because, compared to you, they find themselves wanting.

                Helping others is your calling. It’s why you’re here. Others delight in your outgoing and charitable nature, and you delight in their happiness. You’re at your best when you’re aiding people, either by explaining how they can best overcome a challenge or by demonstrating how to do so yourself.
                Being beneficent means caring for others genuinely rather than being kind for the sake of getting what you want.

                You’re a smooth talker and a charmer. Whether through seemingly supernatural means or just a way with words, you can convince others to do as you wish. Most likely, you’re physically attractive or at least highly charismatic, and others enjoy listening to your voice. You probably pay attention to your appearance, keeping yourself well groomed. You make friends easily.
                You play up the personality facet of your Intellect stat; intelligence is not your strong suit. You’re personable, not necessarily studious or strong-willed.

            <td>
                Happy and optimistic, you rarely feel down. Usually, you wake up with anticipation for what the day will hold. Your good spirits aren’t necessarily something you try to share with others, because you know that what lies in another’s heart isn’t for you to change. But sometimes your mere presence and lighthearted nature is enough to mend sadness. Of course, sometimes bad things happen to you too, and your basic nature is suppressed for a time. But eventually, your light-heartedness always returns.

                You put the good of the many over the needs of the few, at least in a sense. You implicitly understand that only through cooperation can groups of people remain happy and productive. Your experience has shown that cooperation generates greater benefits for everyone in the long term—including access to food, protection, and knowledge. As a result, you tend to become especially invested in whatever community you live in or, perhaps one day, found yourself.

                You’re quick-witted, thinking well on your feet. You understand people, so you can fool them but are rarely fooled. Because you easily see things for what they are, you get the lay of the land swiftly, size up threats and allies, and assess situations with accuracy. Perhaps you’re physically attractive, or maybe you use your wit to overcome any physical or mental imperfections.

                You are wholeheartedly dedicated and loyal to a cause, activity, or job, shrugging off any obstacles that get in your way. When you pick this descriptor, you can work with your GM to figure out what that cause is. For instance, maybe you’re committed to tracking down someone who wronged you long ago. Alternatively, you can wait for a cause to catch your attention in the campaign. Either way, being committed is a personality trait for you, and once you decide to do something, you throw yourself into it with a vengeance.

                You’re self-assured, which helps in almost every situation—at least situations where violence is not involved. Fortunately, because you’re so self-confident and positive, you’re usually able to steer situations away from violent endings. It’s possible that your confidence makes you seem levelheaded and cool in a tough situation, or your confidence could make you eager to prove your skills when the going gets rough—it’s up to you. Either way, others eventually learn that you’re confident for a good reason.

                Your excellent education and privileged upbringing has lent you a refined taste. You’re able to discern degrees of difference where others see, hear, or taste the same thing. Your awareness extends to artistic endeavors and general knowledge of the area you reside in and areas far from you (to the extent this knowledge is possible). You’re an example, if you do say so yourself, of the benefits that civilization can bring to someone. Though that doesn’t mean you can’t appreciate other ways of living.
                Being cultured isn't an accident (or doesn't have to be); anyone can decide to broaden their horizons by trying to learn more, see more, and appreciate things outside their normal experience.

                There once was a time when the prior worlds spoke to the stars, reshaped the creatures of the world, and mastered form and essence. Isn’t that incredible? Each day is a chance to rediscover a secret, a bit of knowledge, a story, or something you can’t even imagine yet. It’s dizzying, when you consider all there is to learn and discover. You’re drawn to explore the ruins of the prior worlds, places that are brand new and unique to the Ninth World, or civilizations that still exist among the stars high overhead.<br><br>Of course, if you’re going to satisfy your curiosity, you need to be careful. Before plunging directly into the unknown, you learn as much as you can about a new area through inquiry or exploration. Otherwise, you might not live long enough to see everything you want to see and do everything you want to do.

You prefer to act when it's fully you making decisions, not a version of you blurred by emotion.

                Driven characters can be "one-note” in some respect, and that can be dull. Some people may want to use Driven as a temporary descriptor that lasts until their mission is done, then choose a different descriptor.
                You have set your sights on a goal, and everything you do is in pursuit of that objective. The thing you seek defines you— shapes your decisions, colors your outlook, and impels you to take action even when your body and mind scream for you to give up and set the task aside, at least for a while. No matter the hardships you face along the way, you believe in your purpose and will let nothing stop you from achieving it.
                When you choose this descriptor, choose a goal that is possible to attain. You might set a goal of finding a lost parent, making a sacrifice at a rumored temple, learning how to perform a particular task, or gaining the funds to pay for a healer to treat a loved one. Once you achieve this goal, you may choose a new one.
                You probably talk about your mission all the time, bringing it up even when it’s only tangentially connected to the conversation.
                You usually consider other pursuits in the context of whether or not it advances your own agenda.

Or you may receive information in a more direct way, feeling a person’s emotions as if they were tangible things, sensations that lightly brush against your mind. Your gift for empathy helps you navigate social situations and control them to avoid misunderstandings and prevent useless conflicts from erupting. The constant bombardment of emotions from those around you likely takes a toll.<br><br>You might move with the prevailing mood, swinging from giddy happiness to bitter sorrow with little warning. Or you might close yourself off and remain inscrutable to others out of a sense of self-preservation or an unconscious fear that everyone else might learn how you truly feel.

                You love people, and they generally love you. You know how to interact with large groups and work the crowd. You’re likely to be a leader, a diplomat, or a very successful businessperson. You enjoy being around people, and you’re generally interested in what they have to say and what they think about things. You ask a lot of questions, and you’re generous and kind to those who deserve it (in fact, you’re often willing to give latitude to people who others would have given up on).

                You conceal your true nature behind a mask and are loath to let anyone see who you really are. Protecting yourself, physically and emotionally, is what you care about most, and you prefer to keep everyone else at a safe distance. You may be suspicious of everyone you meet, expecting the worst from people so you won’t be surprised when they prove you right. Or you might just be a bit reserved, careful about letting people through your gruff exterior to the person you really are.<br><br>No one can be as reserved as you are and make many friends. Most likely, you have an abrasive personality and tend to be pessimistic in your outlook. You probably nurse an old hurt and find that the only way you can cope is to keep it and your personality locked down.

You probably spend a lot of time thinking about your personal honor, how best to maintain it, and how to defend it if challenged. In combat, you are straightforward and offer quarter to any foe. You were likely instilled with this sense of honor by a parent or a mentor. Sometimes the distinction between what is and isn’t honorable varies with different schools of thought, but in broad strokes, honorable people can agree on most aspects of what honor means.

Sometimes, what you imagine becomes a useful idea or something you write, paint, or draw. Mainly, however, you live inside your own head, content to imagine all the things that the world around you sometimes fails to provide.

                You have a hard time tamping down your enthusiasm. Why wait when you can just do it (whatever it is) and get it done? You deal with problems when they arise rather than plan ahead. Putting out the small fires now prevents them from becoming one big fire later. You are the first to take risks, to jump in and lend a hand, to step into dark passages, and to find danger.<br><br>Your impulsiveness likely gets you into trouble. While others might take time to study the numenera they discover, you use such items without hesitation. After all, the best way to learn what something can do is to use it. When a cautious explorer might look around and check for danger nearby, you have to physically stop yourself from bulling on ahead. Why fuss around when the exciting thing is just ahead?<br><br>Impulsive characters get into trouble. That’s their thing, and that’s fine. But if you’re constantly dragging your fellow PCs into trouble (or worse, getting them seriously hurt or killed), that will be annoying, to say the least. A good rule of thumb is that impulsiveness doesn’t always mean a predilection to do the wrong thing. Sometimes it’s the urge to do the right thing.

It gives you pleasure to give your aid to others.

If someone shows you truly incontrovertible evidence that the person or institution that you’ve given yourself to is not worthy, you’d like to think that you would weigh all the evidence and come to a decision based on the facts and the facts alone.

You’re happiest when you’ve got enough time before an event to assemble the best possible selection of tools, provisions, or resources that will contribute toward that event’s overall success. Often, being prepared means having the tools necessary to fix, fashion, or modify another piece of equipment, be it mundane or exotic.
                Any group of PCs is happy to have someone prepared along on a journey, because more often than not, the difference between success and failure is preparation.

                You’ve never been much of a talker. When forced to interact with others, you never think of the right thing to say—words fail you entirely, or they come out all wrong. You often end up saying precisely the wrong thing and insult someone unintentionally. Most of the time, you just keep mum.<br><br>This makes you a listener instead—a careful observer. It also means that you’re better at doing things than talking about them. You’re quick to take action.

            </td>
            <td>
                You try to hide what’s inside, fold it into yourself when everything inside you screams to let go, make them pay, make them hurt, and make them bleed. Sometimes you succeed for your friends—smiling like they smile, laughing when they laugh, and sometimes even having other emotions of your own. But it’s always there, that feeling of frantic glee mixed with hate that sometimes leaps out of you when you confront a foe. Violence your friends can tolerate, but you sometimes worry they will also learn that you are cruel.

            <td>
                You aren’t like anyone else, and that’s fine with you. People don’t seem to understand you—they even seem put off by you—but who cares? You understand the Ninth World better than they do because you’re weird, and so is the world you live in. The concept of “the weird” is well known to you. Strange devices, ancient locales, bizarre creatures, storms that can transform you, living energy fields, and things most people can’t even name populate the world, and you thrive on it. You have a special attachment to it all, and the more you discover about the weirdness in the world, the more you might discover about yourself.<br><br>Weird characters might be mutants or born with strange qualities, but sometimes they started out “normal” and adopted the weird by choice.<br><br>From a certain perspective, almost all Numenera characters are weird. So a character with the Weird descriptor really has to go the extra step. Work with the GM to come up with ways to really make your weird character memorable. Remember, though, weird doesn’t mean insane or evil. In fact, if Numenera teaches us anything, it’s that weird is good.

                <b>Distinctive Physical Quirk:</b> You have a unique physical aspect that is, well, bizarre.<br>For example, perhaps instead of hair, you have metal spikes on your head. Perhaps your hands don’t connect to your arms, although they move as if they do. Maybe a third eye stares out from the side of your head, superfluous tendrils grow from your back, or you have no nose. Whatever it is, your quirk might be a mutation, a biomechanical transformation, or a feature with no explanation.<br><br><b>A Sense for the Weird:</b> Sometimes—at the GM’s discretion—weird things relating to the numenera or its effects on the world seem to call out to you. You can sense them from afar, and if you get within long range of such a thing, you can sense whether it is overtly dangerous or not.<br>
