                for you by the GM), one oddity (chosen for you by the GM), and 4 shins (coins). Before selecting your
                weapons, armor, and other gear, you might want to wait until after you’ve chosen your esoteries,
                descriptor, and focus.<br><br><b>Community Scholar:</b> While you are present within a community, and
                actively and personally working on behalf of that community, the community’s health and infrastructure
                are both increased by +1. Enabler.<br><br><b>Nano Player Intrusions:</b> you can spend 1 XP to use one
                of the following player intrusions, provided the situation is appropriate and the GM agrees.<br><b>-
                    Advantageous Malfunction:</b> a numenera device that is being used against you malfunctions. It
                might harm the user or one of their allies for a round, or activate a dramatic and distracting side
                effect for a few rounds.<br><b>- Convenient Glimmer:</b> a glimmer provides you with a clear answer or
                suggests a course of action with regard to an urgent question, problem, or obstacle you’re
                facing.<br><b>- Inexplicably Unbroken:</b> an inactive, ruined, or presumed-destroyed device temporarily
                activates and performs a useful function relevant to the situation. This is enough to buy you some time
                for a better solution, alleviate a complication that was interfering with your abilities, or just get
                you one more use out of a depleted cypher or artifact.<br>

            <td><b>Hedge Magic (1 Intellect point):</b> You can perform small tricks: temporarily change the color or
                basic appearance of a small object, cause small objects to float through the air, clean a small area,
                mend a broken object, prepare (but not create) food, and so on. You can’t use Hedge Magic to harm
                another creature or object. Action.<br>
            </td>
            <td><b>Adaptation (2+ Intellect points):</b> You adapt to a hostile environment for 28 hours. As a result,
                you can breathe safely, the temperature doesn’t kill you (though it might be extremely uncomfortable or
                debilitating), crushing gravity doesn’t incapacitate or harm you (though, again, you might be seriously
                hindered), and so on. In extreme environments, the GM might increase the cost of activating this esotery
                to a maximum cost of 10 Intellect points. Roughly speaking, the cost should equal the amount of damage
                you would sustain in a given round. For example, if you enter a hostile environment that would normally
                deal 6 points of damage per round, using Adaptation to avoid that damage costs 6 points. You can protect
                other creatures in addition to yourself, but each additional creature costs you the same number of
                Intellect points as it costs to protect you. Thus, if it costs 6 points to protect yourself, it costs 12
                more to protect two other people. This esotery never protects against quick, instantaneous threats, like
                an attack with a weapon or a sudden explosion of fire. Action to initiate.<br>
            </td>
            <td><b>Barrier (3+ Intellect points):</b> You create an opaque, stationary barrier of solid energy within
                immediate range. The barrier is 10 feet by 10 feet (3 m by 3 m) and of negligible thickness. It is a
                level 2 barrier and lasts for ten minutes. It can be placed anywhere it fits, whether against a solid
                object (including the ground) or floating in the air. Each level of Effort you apply strengthens the
                barrier by one level. For example, applying two levels of Effort creates a level 4 barrier. Action.<br>
            </td>
            <td><b>Invisibility (4 Intellect points):</b> You become invisible for ten minutes. While invisible, you are
                specialized in stealth and Speed defense tasks. This effect ends if you do something to reveal your
                presence or position—attacking, performing an esotery, using an ability, moving a large object, and so
                on. If this occurs, you can regain the remaining invisibility effect by taking an action to focus on
                hiding your position. Action to initiate or reinitiate.<br>
            </td>
            <td><b>Absorb Energy (7 Intellect points):</b> You touch an object and absorb its energy. If you touch a
                cypher, you render it useless. If you touch an artifact, roll for the artifact’s depletion. If you touch
                another kind of powered machine or device, the GM determines whether its power is fully drained. In any
                case, you absorb energy from the object touched and regain 1d10 Intellect points. If this would give you
                more Intellect than your Pool’s maximum, the extra points are lost, and you must make a Might defense
                roll. The difficulty of the roll is equal to the number of points over your maximum you absorbed. If you
                fail the roll, you take 5 points of damage and are unable to act for one round. You can use this esotery
                as a defense action when you’re the target of an incoming esotery. Doing so cancels the incoming
                esotery, and you absorb the energy as if it were a device. Action.<br>
            </td>
            <td><b>Control Weather (10 Intellect points):</b> You change the weather in your general region. If
                performed indoors, this esotery creates only minor weather effects, such as mist, mild temperature
                changes, and so on. If performed outside, you can create rain, fog, snow, wind, or any other kind of
                normal (not overly severe) weather. The change lasts for a natural length of time, so a storm might last
                for an hour, fog for two or three hours, and snow for a few hours (or for ten minutes if it’s out of
                season). For the first ten minutes after activating this esotery, you can create more dramatic and
                specific effects, such as lightning strikes, giant hailstones, twisters, hurricane force winds, and so
                on. These effects must occur within 1,000 feet (300 m) of your location. You must spend your turn
                concentrating to create an effect or to maintain it in a new round. These effects inflict 6 points of
                damage each round. Action.<br>

            <td><b>Onslaught (1 Intellect point):</b> You attack a foe using energies that assail either their physical
                form or their mind. In either case, you must be able to see your target. If the attack is physical, you
                emit a short-range ray of force that inflicts 4 points of damage. If the attack is mental, you focus
                your mental energy to blast the thought processes of another creature within short range. This mindslice
                inflicts 2 points of Intellect damage (and thus ignores Armor). Using Effort to add damage in this case
                adds only 2 points per level of Effort. Some creatures without minds (such as automatons) might be
                immune to your mindslice. Action.<br>
            </td>
            <td><b>Flash (4 Intellect points):</b> You create an explosion of energy at a point within short range,
                affecting an area up to immediate range from that point. You must be able to see the location where you
                intend to center the explosion. The blast inflicts 2 points of damage to all creatures or objects within
                the area. Because this is an area attack, adding Effort to increase your damage works differently than
                it does for singletarget attacks. If you apply a level of Effort to increase the damage, add 2 points of
                damage for each target, and even if you fail your attack roll, all targets in the area still take 1
                point of damage. Action.<br>
            </td>
            <td><b>Countermeasures (4 Intellect points):</b> You immediately end one ongoing numenera effect (such as an
                effect created by an esotery) within immediate range. Alternatively, you can use this as a defense
                action to cancel any incoming esotery targeted at you, or you can cancel any numenera device or the
                effect of any numenera device for 1d6 rounds. You must touch the effect or device to cancel it.
                Action.<br>
            </td>
            <td><b>Mind Control (6+ Intellect points):</b> You control the actions of another creature you touch. This
                effect lasts for one minute. The target must be level 2 or lower. Once you have established control, you
                maintain mental contact with the target and sense what it senses. You can allow it to act freely or
                override its control on a case-by-case basis. In addition to the normal options for using Effort, you
                can choose to use Effort to increase the maximum level of the target or increase the duration by one
                minute. Thus, to control the mind of a level 5 target (three levels above the normal limit) or control a
                target for four minutes (three levels above the normal duration), you must apply three levels of Effort.
                Smart Nanos use the Scan esotery on a creature to learn its level before trying to control its mind.
                When the Mind Control esotery ends, the creature doesn’t remember being controlled or anything it did
                while under your command. Action to initiate.<br>
            </td>
            <td><b>Dust to Dust (7+ Intellect points):</b> You disintegrate one object that is smaller than you and
                whose level is less than or equal to 5. You must touch the object to affect it. If the GM feels it
                appropriate to the circumstances, you can disintegrate a portion of an object (the total volume of which
                is smaller than you) rather than the entire thing. You can apply level of Effort to increase the maximum
                level of the target. Action.<br>
            </td>
            <td><b>Move Mountains (9 Intellect points):</b> You exert a tremendous amount of physical force within 250
                feet (75 m) of you. You can push up to 10 tons (9 t) of material up to 50 feet (15 m). This force can
                collapse buildings, redirect small rivers, or perform other dramatic effects. Action.<br>
            </td>

        <tr>
            <td>option
            </td>
            <td><b>Push (2 Intellect points):</b> You push a creature or object an immediate distance in any direction
                you wish. You must be able to see the target, which must be your size or smaller, must not be affixed to
                anything, and must be within short range. The push is quick, and the force is too crude to be
                manipulated. For example, you can’t use this esotery to pull a lever or even close a door. Action.<br>
            </td>
            <td><b>Hover (2 Intellect points):</b> You float slowly into the air. If you concentrate, you can control
                your movement to remain motionless in the air or float up to a short distance as your action; otherwise,
                you drift with the wind or with any momentum you have gained. This effect lasts for up to ten minutes.
                Action to initiate.<br>
            </td>
            <td><b>Energy Protection (3+ Intellect points):</b> Choose a discrete type of energy that you have
                experience with (such as heat, sonic, electricity, and so on). You gain +5 to Armor against damage from
                that type of energy for ten minutes. Alternatively, you gain +1 to Armor against damage from that energy
                for 28 hours. You must be familiar with the type of energy; for example, if you have no experience with
                a certain kind of extradimensional energy, you can’t protect against it. In addition to the normal
                options for using Effort, you can choose to use Effort to protect more targets; each level of Effort
                used in this way affects up to two additional targets. You must touch additional targets to protect
                them. Action to initiate.<br>
            </td>
            <td><b>Regeneration (6 Intellect points):</b> You restore points to a target’s Might or Speed Pool in one of
                two ways: either the chosen Pool regains up to 6 points, or it is restored to a total value of 12. You
                make this decision when you initiate this esotery. Points are regenerated at a rate of 1 point each
                round. You must maintain contact with the target the whole time. In no case can this raise a Pool higher
                than its maximum. Action.<br>
            </td>
            <td><b>Knowing the Unknown (6 Intellect points):</b> Tapping into the datasphere, you can ask the GM one
                question and get a general answer. The GM assigns a level to the question, so the more obscure the
                answer, the more difficult the task. Generally, knowledge that you could find by looking somewhere other
                than your current location is level 1, and obscure knowledge of the past is level 7. Gaining knowledge
                of the future is impossible. Action.<br>
            </td>
            <td><b>Traverse the Worlds (8+ Intellect points):</b> You instantaneously transmit yourself to another
                planet, dimension, plane, or level of reality. You must know that the destination exists; the GM will
                decide if you have enough information to confirm its existence and the level of difficulty to reach the
                destination. In addition to the normal options for using Effort, you can choose to use Effort to bring
                other people with you; each level of Effort used in this way affects up to three additional targets. You
                must touch any additional targets. Action.<br>

            <td><b>Scan (2 Intellect points):</b> You scan an area equal in size to a 10-foot (3 m) cube, including all
                objects or creatures within that area. The area must be within short range. Scanning a creature or
                object always reveals its level (a measure of how powerful, dangerous, or difficult it is). You also
                learn whatever facts the GM feels are pertinent about the matter and energy in that area. For example,
                you might learn that the wooden box contains a device of metal and synth. You might learn that the glass
                cylinder is full of poisonous gas, and that its metal stand has an electrical field running through it
                that connects to a metal mesh in the floor. You might learn that the creature standing before you is a
                mammal with a small brain. However, this esotery doesn’t tell you what the information means. Thus, in
                the first example, you don’t know what the metal and synth device does. In the second, you don’t know if
                stepping on the floor causes the cylinder to release the gas. In the third, you might suspect that the
                creature is not very intelligent, but scans, like looks, can be deceiving. Many materials and energy
                fields prevent or resist scanning. Action.<br>
            </td>
            <td><b>Mind Reading (4 Intellect points):</b> You can read the surface thoughts of a creature within short
                range of you, even if the target doesn’t want you to. You must be able to see the target. Once you have
                established contact, you can read the target’s thoughts for up to one minute. If you or the target move
                out of range, the connection is broken. Action to initiate.<br>
            </td>
            <td><b>Sensor (4 Intellect points):</b> You create an immobile, invisible sensor within immediate range that
                lasts for 28 hours. At any time during that duration, you can concentrate to see, hear, and smell
                through the sensor, no matter how far you move from it. The sensor doesn’t grant you sensory
                capabilities beyond the norm. Action to create; action to check.<br>
            </td>
            <td><b>Reshape (5 Intellect points):</b> You reshape matter within short range in an area no larger than a
                5-foot (1.5 m) cube. If you use only one action on this esotery, the changes you make are crude at best.
                If you spend at least ten minutes and succeed at an appropriate crafting task (which is hindered, due to
                the circumstances), you can make complex changes to the material. You can’t change the nature of the
                material, only its shape. Thus, you can make a hole in a wall or floor, or you can seal one up. You can
                fashion a rudimentary sword from a large piece of iron. You can break or repair a chain. With multiple
                uses of this esotery, you could bring about large changes, making a bridge, a wall, or a similar
                structure. Action.<br>
            </td>
            <td><b>Teleportation (6+ Intellect points):</b> You instantaneously transmit yourself to any location that
                you have seen or been to, no matter the distance, as long as it is on Earth (or whatever world you’re
                currently on). In addition to the normal options for using Effort, you can choose to use Effort to bring
                other people with you; each level of Effort used in this way affects up to three additional targets. You
                must touch any additional targets. Action.<br>
            </td>
            <td><b>Earthquake (10 Intellect points):</b> You trigger an earthquake centered on a spot you can see within
                1,000 feet (305 m). The ground within 250 feet (76 m) of that spot heaves and shakes for five minutes,
                causing widespread damage to structures and terrain in the area. Buildings made of wood, stone, or brick
                collapse, walls topple, cliffs crumble, ceilings cave in, some areas of ground rise up, and other areas
                sink. Characters inside collapsed buildings or beneath a crumbling cliff or falling wall are subject to
                a crush or a huge crush and may have to dig themselves free, as the GM decides. A crush inflicts 3
                points of damage, and a huge crush deals 6 points. Furthermore, the force of the quake is sufficient to
                knock creatures to the ground and prevent them from standing until the shaking stops. Action to
