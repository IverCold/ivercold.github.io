The device uses the datasphere to locate the creature and speeds off toward it by the shortest and fastest available route. The device flies about 30 mph (48 kph) and maneuvers around obstacles. If blocked by a solid object, it goes out of phase, along with the cypher it carries, and moves through the object until it emerges into an open space. The device activates its detonation cypher when it reaches the target or after 28 hours, whichever comes first.",

However, it has no consciousness and remains in a comatose state in the tank. Once the clone has matured, if at any time the user dies while wearing the headband, her consciousness is transferred into the clone, regardless of distance. All skills, abilities, and knowledge are transferred. The user does not need to wear the headband throughout the process (if, for example, she is worried about her cypher limit)—just at the beginning to spur the clone’s growth. However, if she dies while not wearing the headband, no transfer occurs.",

However, the minds of most users are insufficient to fully comprehend the vast implications of the reality they change. This means that the wish fulfillment may not be entirely what they thought it would be. The repercussions are too varied to list, but here are a few examples: • A complex object created is brittle, of poor quality, or made of a substance that turns out to be dangerous. • A significant change to the past results in a “bubble” of space-time in which the change occurred, trapping the user in a sort of limited closed dimension, even while normal, unchanged reality continues outside the bubble. • Creatures altered by the change develop health issues ranging from new allergies or minor ailments to cancer or mutations. • Minds altered by the change suffer from long-term trauma, confusion, memory loss, or brain damage. Using a wish disk is taxing. The user moves two steps down the damage track. Sometimes, a PC’s use of a wish disk should work as expected.

Prerecorded sounds are about as loud as a ravage bear, but a user-recorded sound is exactly as loud as what the user recorded.",

The user must make a level 3 Intellect defense roll to correctly interpret the signals (such as “brain parasite,” “lung cancer,” “blood venom,” or “stomach fungus”). The alarm repeats every hour unless the user acknowledges it with a firm tap, and it repeats each day until the threat is ended. Once the graft attaches, the effect is permanent, and this device no longer counts against the number of cyphers that a PC can bear. At level 6 and higher, the graft can also be activated to neutralize an internal threat if it is of a lower level than the cypher, but thereafter the graft works only as a detector, like the lower-level varieties.",

For example, if the user’s hand is out of phase, they could punch an abykos (whether the creature is solid, partially solid, or insubstantial), reach through a solid wall, or pick up an extradimensional object. For cyphers of level 1 to 4, this pandimensional state extends just beyond the user’s flesh (including clothing and armor on that limb, a small object that can be held in a closed fist, and so on). For cyphers of level 5 or higher, the pandimensional field reaches about 6 inches (15 cm) farther, allowing the user to also affect a small weapon or tool held in that limb. A careful user with an extradimensional limb could attack an opponent with a phased weapon, turning the limb and weapon solid at just the right moment to bypass the foe’s Armor, but the attack would be hindered by two steps because the user would be harmed if their flesh turned solid inside the opponent.",

The model lasts for one hour per cypher level, after which it melts into harmless goo.

If the ability costs Pool points to use, the character must spend them to activate the ability. If the next higher tier grants more than one ability, the user gains both abilities. If the tier allows a choice of different abilities, randomly determine which one it grants. If the user already has one of the abilities of that tier, the cypher grants the other ability from that tier, or an unselected ability from a lower tier. For example, a tier 2 Nano with the Commands Mental Powers focus who uses a level 3 version of this cypher would gain either the Psychic Burst ability or the Psychic Suggestion ability. If the GM is using alternative focus abilities from chapter 3, those may be options as well for a precognitive focus inducer.

If salvage is discovered, either it grants an asset to the user’s attempt to find a specific kind of iotum, or it gives the user one additional roll on the Random Salvage Result table.",

    "Effect": "The cypher disperses stealth particles over the surface of an object (or several objects) that can fit in an area 10 feet (3 m) on a side. The object is no longer visible to casual observation, and tasks specifically made to find or perceive the treated object(s) are hindered by two steps. The effect lasts until the objects are moved or damaged.",

    "Effect": "When applied to a creature’s head, the disc immediately unleashes microfilaments that enter the brain. Within five minutes, the creature is trained in tasks related to living off the land, including finding sources of food and water. If the creature is already trained or specialized in such tasks, the graft has no effect. Once the graft attaches, the effect is permanent, and this device no longer counts against the number of cyphers that a PC can bear, but the disc remains. A creature with a sustenance graft who attempts the long-term task Build Up Food or Water Stores accomplishes that task in half the normal time.",
