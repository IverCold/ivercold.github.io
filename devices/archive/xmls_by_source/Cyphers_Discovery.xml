    <Effect>When applied to a creature’s head, the disk immediately unleashes microfilaments that enter the brain.

This is true even of creatures that do not normally have a language. If the creature could already understand the language, the cypher has no effect. Once the graft attaches, the effect is permanent, and this device no longer counts against the number of cyphers that a PC can bear.</Effect>

It can make attacks or perform actions as ordered to the best of its abilities, but it cannot speak. The automaton has short-range movement but never goes farther than long range away from the character who activated it. At the GM’s discretion, the servant might have specialized knowledge, such as how to operate a particular device. Otherwise, it has no special knowledge.
