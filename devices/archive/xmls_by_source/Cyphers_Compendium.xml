    <Name>Access Glasses</Name>
    <Level>1d6 + 1</Level>
    <Effect>The user can see through up to half an inch of solid material and can pass his hands and anything his hands are holding through that solid matter. Once the area to be looked and passed through is chosen—about 18 inches by 18 inches (46 cm by 46 cm)—a new area cannot be chosen. However, the effect lasts for an hour. Although some people might use the access glasses to peer into a locked box and remove the contents, many have found that it’s most useful to those who work with the numenera by allowing them to pass through the outer casing of a device to get at the workings inside. Doing so can offer up to two levels of assets in repairing or tinkering with a device with many internal components.</Effect>

    <Name>Adamant Foam</Name>
    <Level>1d6 + 1</Level>
    <Effect>The foam in this canister is extraordinarily light—almost weightless, lighter than a soap bubble—and virtually invisible. It’s possible, in fact, to have this foam in your hand and not even realize it. And yet the foam, which dries on contact with the air, is superstrong. While pliable, it’s as unbreakable as steel mesh. The canister has enough foam to coat an area 6 feet by 6 feet (2 m by 2 m) with a thin layer. Although this foam has many uses, if sprayed on a living target, that target has +2 to Armor. Adamant foam disintegrates after 28 hours.</Effect>

    <Effect>Six minutes after activation, the worm inflates and excretes 1d6 wet, shuddering eggs at a place the user designates. After laying the eggs, the worm slithers back to the user and coils around one of his limbs, gripping tightly. For the next seven hours, whenever a creature approaches within 5 feet (2 m) of the eggs, the worm tightens and exudes a thick orange slime that reeks of rotten meat. When the effect ends, the worm relaxes its grip, falls, and expires messily.</Effect>

    <Effect>When one gazes through a blue crystal, for a brief moment she can view a spot corresponding to her current position in a parallel universe. Moreover, the view is set a few moments in the future. However, since the crystal shows a parallel universe, the future seen may or may not be an accurate reflection of her reality. The user, then, sees a possible future. Normally, there is about a 30% chance that the glimpse is entirely accurate and a 30% chance that it is partially accurate, but these numbers depend on the circumstances. The GM should decide what a PC sees through a blue crystal based on what is most likely to happen, and then allow actual play to determine whether what was seen was entirely accurate, partially accurate, or inaccurate.</Effect>

    <Name>Burrowing Bubble</Name>
    <Level>1d6 + 4</Level>
    <Effect>Upon activation, for ten minutes, the user is surrounded by a bubble of energy that projects incredible heat outward, but not inward. This bubble floats 1 foot (0.3 m) in the air, inflicts 6 points of damage to all within immediate range, and inflicts 3 points of damage to all within short range. Further, it instantly melts the material directly below (of lower level than the cypher), and the bubble sinks an immediate distance into the new hole it created. This continues for the duration of the effect, so a user who stands on the ground when activating this cypher ends up about 800 feet (244 m) underground when it finally stops. If the user concentrates, she can force the bubble to move an immediate distance in any direction she chooses as an action. The user cannot penetrate the bubble, and neither can forces from the outside. Not even ambient damage gets through. Dealing at least 50 points of damage to the bubble (which has no Armor) destroys it. Damaging the bubble does not harm the user inside until the bubble is destroyed, at which point she falls from whatever height the bubble was at, which is at least 1 foot (0.3 m) in the air.</Effect>

The screen bears an animate image appropriate to the surrounding area, such as trees and brush in a forest, sandy dunes in a desert, and so on. Thus, anything behind the screen is easily hidden from visual observation unless the viewer is within immediate distance (and even then it may be obscured, depending on the circumstances). If you cobble together a camouflage screen and a pushpull beam (task difficulty 7), you create a cypher that fires a beam up to long range that encapsulates a target in a bubble of solid light about 8 feet (2 m) across. The target can’t take physical actions or perceive through the bubble for ten minutes.</Effect>

    <Effect>When activated, the cypher surrounds the user with a nimbus of energy, giving him +10 to Armor that works only against caustic damage. This lasts for one round, and the Armor is ablative, which is to say that each point of damage that it absorbs destroys 1 point of the Armor. The cypher also releases fourteen hailstonesized motes of roiling caustic fluid that fly toward and attack all targets (including the user) within immediate range, one mote per target. If there are not fourteen targets within immediate range, the motes fly out to short range. If there are not fourteen targets within short range, they fly out to long range. If there are not fourteen targets within long range, the targets within long range get attacked twice (or more times) each, starting with those in immediate range.</Effect>

At the same time, red streaks of energy lance out at a number of intelligent targets within short range equal to the cypher level. If there are more targets than streaks of energy, the targets are determined randomly, meaning that the user could be a target. The streaks of energy are extradimensional conduits tying the targets to an ultraterrestrial intelligence with a level equal to the cypher level. The intelligence attempts to control the targets’ actions for one round per cypher level. (Eligible targets include machine intelligences or any living creature more substantial than an insect.) The ultraterrestrial intelligence has a motive and understanding all its own, but it is utterly alien.

    <Effect>Once initiated, the device collects the most widely available atmospheric aerosols within long range (such as drit dust, water droplets, pollen, bacteria, or smoke). It brings those aerosols together in a whirling tornado that centers around the device itself. Anything in close range of the tornado takes damage equal to the cypher level. Deployers are complex numenera devices that are almost always fashioned rather than cobbled or scavenged. Their main purpose is to simplify the process of arranging or moving things strategically for the user. Deployers can arrange everything from cells and light waves to sentient, living creatures into specific, complicated patterns and reactions.

    <Effect>Explodes in an immediate radius with a grey mist. Living creatures affected in the area begin to transform into plants. Player characters exposed to the mist must attempt three Might defense rolls (any Effort used on one roll is applied to all three). The final result depends on the result of the rolls: No successes: Over the course of ten minutes, the character’s flesh turns green and begins to sprout shoots. He permanently turns into a human-shaped plant. One success: Over the course of ten minutes, the character’s flesh turns green and begins to sprout shoots. Her body stiffens and she cannot move for 28 hours as she takes root. At the end of that time, she becomes a humanshaped plant. However, if someone keeps her from taking root, she returns to normal over the course of another 28 hours, during which time she can take no actions. Two successes: Over the course of ten minutes, the character’s flesh turns green and begins to sprout shoots. This is a painful process. At the ten-minute mark, he moves one step down the damage track, and he remains that way until he returns to normal 28 hours later. Three successes: The character is not affected at all. NPCs in the area who are one level lower than the cypher are affected as if they had two successes. NPCs who are two or three levels lower are affected as if they had one success. NPCs who are four or more levels lower than the cypher are affected as if they had no successes. All plants in the area gain a permanent +1 level boost.</Effect>

      </Row>
      <Row>
        <Roll>04</Roll>
        <Result>If the device has immediate range, the range is increased to short. If short, it is increased to long. If long, it is increased to 200 feet (61 m). Such changes to the device last for 28 hours. If the device does not have a ranged effect, it instead affects the user when activated so that the user moves a long distance on an action for 28 hours. This latter effect can be used once.</Result>
      </Row>
      <Row>
        <Roll>05</Roll>
        <Result>The device, when activated, also makes the user invisible for an hour. While invisible the user is specialized in stealth and Speed defense tasks. This effect ends if he does something to reveal his presence or position—attacking, performing an esotery, using an ability, and so on. If this occurs, he can regain the remaining invisibility effect by taking an action to focus on hiding his position. This functions once, regardless of whether the enhanced device is a cypher or an artifact. 06 The device now also restores a total of 4 points each time it is activated. The user can allocate those points among his stat Pools as desired, but the Pools cannot go above their maximum. If the device already restores points to Pools, it restores 2 additional points.

The headband in the tank facilitates the rapid growth of a clone in one month. The clone is a fully grown creature, identical in every physical way to the user. However, it has no consciousness and remains in a comatose state in the tank. Once the clone has matured, if at any time the user dies while wearing the headband, her consciousness is transferred into the clone, regardless of distance. All skills, abilities, and knowledge are transferred. The user does not need to wear the headband throughout the process (if, for example, she is worried about her cypher limit)—just at the beginning to spur the clone’s growth.

If the contents of a fungal garden are carefully mixed with the paste of a beauty mask (task difficulty 6), the resulting concoction is a cypher that can coat a surface or object about the size of a human. The stain left behind glows as bright as a glowglobe forever. Touching a mushroom causes spores to fall from the cap onto anything below. Each time this happens, roll a d6 to see what the spores do to all creatures they touch. Roll a d6 for effect:</Effect>

    <Effect>To activate the device, the user must place his hand or foot into the container. The gel flows over his appendage and spreads across his body until it completely encases him. The gel retains its semiliquid consistency for 28 hours. While the gel covers the user, it prevents him from taking damage from acid, cold, electricity, or fire. In addition, whenever he takes damage from being struck by an object, he temporarily gains +1 to Armor until the next round ends as the gel briefly hardens in response to the hit.</Effect>

    <Effect>When activated, an incorporeal duplicate of the user appears and remains for ten minutes. The duplicate does not have a mind of its own. Rather, the user controls both forms, but only one at a time. Switching consciousness between forms is an action. While the user’s consciousness focuses on one form, the other stands motionless. The duplicate moves at the same speed as the user’s normal form, but there is no limit to how far apart the two can be. The duplicate is ghostly and translucent. It can pass through solid matter and cannot be harmed except by special transdimensional weapons and effects. It likewise cannot affect normal matter in any way. While moving as the incorporeal duplicate, the user gains an asset for all stealth tasks. When the duplicate’s duration ends (or it is somehow destroyed), the user’s mind returns to his normal body. If the normal body is slain, the user stays in the duplicate, but only for the remaining duration.</Effect>

    <Effect>Anyone wearing the mask begins to slowly lose her mind. The mask causes 1d6 + 2 points of Intellect damage each round for a number of rounds equal to the cypher level. Alternatively, if someone’s Intellect Pool is already at 0, she can attempt to gain Intellect points by wearing the mask. Wearers who start with 0 in their Intellect Pool gain 1d6 – 2 Intellect points each round for a number of rounds equal to the cypher level. If the resulting number is negative, the wearer takes those points out of the next Pool in succession. For example, if the wearer is at 0 Intellect points and rolls a natural 1, she loses 1 point from her Might Pool. If her Might Pool is already at 0, the point of damage comes out of her Speed Pool instead.</Effect>

The difficulty for any attack with the device is increased by one step, and a roll of 1 or 2 on the die suggests that a different target (if any) was struck. The jolter emits the bolt for four rounds, each round inflicting the same damage, but using it each round is an action and requires a new roll. There is no way to turn the jolter off once activated, so activating it is a four-round commitment. A user that does not control a jolter in a round will be struck by the bolt of electricity herself.</Effect>

The tube has enough gel to cover an area of about 10 feet by 10 feet by 10 feet (3 m by 3 m by 3 m), expanding it into an area of about 50 feet by 50 feet by 50 feet (15 m by 15 m by 15 m). Quadraturin GM Intrusion: Imprecise application can bend space, making an area that expands in one dimension more than the others, or perhaps an area that never stops expanding.</Effect>

(A target can take this damage only once per round regardless of how many times it passes through the mesh.) Anything reduced to 0 health by the mesh is sliced into pieces that are 1 inch (3 cm) wide and tall.</Effect>

    <Effect>This cypher comes as a pair of items, but one is the master of the other. When the master item is activated, the creature wearing the other item is surrounded by a force shield that provides Armor equal to the cypher level for ten minutes. While one character could wear both items, many people use ranged protectors to put a shield around a pet, a child, or a defenseless charge who cannot normally activate a cypher. The master item can be activated from any range to surround its counterpart with the protective shield.</Effect>

    <Effect>If a mammalian or reptilian creature has not been dead for more than 28 hours, this device restores a basic semblance of life by reactivating its nervous system. The creature does not have the knowledge, skills, personality, or memories of its former self. It’s just a mindless shell that can perform basic motor functions: walk, run, or otherwise move; pick up and hold objects; and make crude attacks. The reanimated creature obeys the verbal commands of the user and operates for one hour before collapsing.

    <Name>Vision Subjugator</Name>
    <Level>1d6 + 1</Level>
    <Effect>Inhibits brain function in a target within short range for one hour so that the target’s vision is affected. The user can specify one category of creatures, objects, substances, and so on that the victim cannot see. The effect is extremely specific, so that if “humans” are selected, the victim cannot see people but would still see clothing worn, objects carried, and so on. Possible categories might include (but are not limited to): metal, vapor, water, mammals, synth, weapons, numenera, the color blue, and plants. It’s worth noting that this does not grant the victim X-ray vision. If he cannot see stone and he stands next to a stone wall, his brain creates what he sees instead out of whole cloth based on the context of what he can see. This can lead to seriously delusional behavior.</Effect>

    <Effect>This device does nothing upon activation or in the next two rounds. In the fourth round, it begins to create intense heat. This heat does 12 points of damage to all creatures within immediate range, 6 points of damage to all within short range, and 3 points of damage to all within long range. This effect lasts for three rounds. After that, damage within all ranges starts to fade at a rate of 1 point of damage per round. It is likely that after a volcanic heart is depleted, the surrounding area is a small wasteland of burning slag.</Effect>

The target is covered by these bioengineered mites, which immediately begin biting and stinging the target. The target takes 1 point of damage each round for a number of rounds equal to the cypher level. Further, during each of these rounds, the target is distracted, and the difficulty of all tasks it undertakes is increased by one step.</Effect>

    <Name>Wish Disk</Name>
    <Level>10</Level>
    <Effect>The user states a change in reality that she wishes to have happen, and it—or something very like it—occurs. This warping of reality can affect matter, energy, and time. Objects can be created or destroyed, creatures can be slain, and events from the past can be undone. Reality can be altered so that dead beings are still alive (because they never died). However, the minds of most users are insufficient to fully comprehend the vast implications of the reality they change. This means that the wish fulfillment may not be entirely what they thought it would be. The repercussions are too varied to list, but here are a few examples: • A complex object created is brittle, of poor quality, or made of a substance that turns out to be dangerous. • A significant change to the past results in a “bubble” of space-time in which the change occurred, trapping the user in a sort of limited closed dimension, even while normal, unchanged reality continues outside the bubble. • Creatures altered by the change develop health issues ranging from new allergies or minor ailments to cancer or mutations. • Minds altered by the change suffer from long-term trauma, confusion, memory loss, or brain damage. Using a wish disk is taxing. The user moves two steps down the damage track. Sometimes, a PC’s use of a wish disk should work as expected. If it is simple, straightforward, and not outlandish in power or scope, reality is changed without repercussions. Negative aftereffects, as suggested, might come as the result of a GM intrusion.</Effect>

    <Effect>To activate the device, the user blows through one end of the tube to propel the cartridge’s contents out the other at a creature within immediate range. If the creature is hit by the powder, and its level is equal to or lower than the cypher level, it becomes stunned for one minute. During this time, if the user speaks to the target in a language the target can understand, she can implant a suggestion in the target’s mind. This suggestion is a course of activity the target must follow under the specific conditions the user describes. The course of activity can be anything she chooses, though it cannot be anything that poses a significant risk to the target’s life, property, or loved ones. The conditions can be as general or as specific as the user decides. If the described conditions happen during the next 28 hours, the target behaves as instructed.</Effect>
