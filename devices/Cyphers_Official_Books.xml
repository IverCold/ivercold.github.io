Otherwise, the duplicate organ or limb withers and dies. Duplicate organs must be used within one week.

    <Effect>When one gazes through a blue crystal, for a brief moment she can view a spot corresponding to her current position in a parallel universe. Moreover, the view is set a few moments in the future. However, since the crystal shows a parallel universe, the future seen may or may not be an accurate reflection of her reality. The user, then, sees a possible future. Normally, there is about a 30% chance that the glimpse is entirely accurate and a 30% chance that it is partially accurate, but these numbers depend on the circumstances. The GM should decide what a PC sees through a blue crystal based on what is most likely to happen, and then allow actual play to determine whether what was seen was entirely accurate, partially accurate, or inaccurate.</Effect>

    <Name>Burrowing Bubble</Name>
    <Level>1d6 + 4</Level>
    <Effect>Upon activation, for ten minutes, the user is surrounded by a bubble of energy that projects incredible heat outward, but not inward. This bubble floats 1 foot (0.3 m) in the air, inflicts 6 points of damage to all within immediate range, and inflicts 3 points of damage to all within short range. Further, it instantly melts the material directly below (of lower level than the cypher), and the bubble sinks an immediate distance into the new hole it created. This continues for the duration of the effect, so a user who stands on the ground when activating this cypher ends up about 800 feet (244 m) underground when it finally stops. If the user concentrates, she can force the bubble to move an immediate distance in any direction she chooses as an action. The user cannot penetrate the bubble, and neither can forces from the outside. Not even ambient damage gets through. Dealing at least 50 points of damage to the bubble (which has no Armor) destroys it. Damaging the bubble does not harm the user inside until the bubble is destroyed, at which point she falls from whatever height the bubble was at, which is at least 1 foot (0.3 m) in the air.</Effect>

The screen bears an animate image appropriate to the surrounding area, such as trees and brush in a forest, sandy dunes in a desert, and so on. Thus, anything behind the screen is easily hidden from visual observation unless the viewer is within immediate distance (and even then it may be obscured, depending on the circumstances). If you cobble together a camouflage screen and a pushpull beam (task difficulty 7), you create a cypher that fires a beam up to long range that encapsulates a target in a bubble of solid light about 8 feet (2 m) across.

This lasts for one round, and the Armor is ablative, which is to say that each point of damage that it absorbs destroys 1 point of the Armor. The cypher also releases fourteen hailstonesized motes of roiling caustic fluid that fly toward and attack all targets (including the user) within immediate range, one mote per target. If there are not fourteen targets within immediate range, the motes fly out to short range. If there are not fourteen targets within short range, they fly out to long range.

At the end of this time, a full-grown creature, identical in every physical way to the donor creature, emerges from the tank, and the device deactivates. The clone is a level 1 creature. It can communicate in a language known to the user, but otherwise it understands nothing of the world. It becomes a unique character that develops a personality, objectives, and nature of its own.</Effect>

Once activated, a bright white mote flies up from the device into the sky and explodes, throwing grey tendrils out for 1 mile (2 km) in all directions. After one minute, the tendrils become dark clouds, and after another minute, the skies open up and drench the ground below with heavy rains. In fireezing temperatures, the precipitation is sleet, ice, or snow. With the rain comes lightning and thunder. The storm moves with the prevailing winds and dissipates 1d6 hours later.</Usable>

As they inflate, they rise above the box, revealing an empty compartment. A sturdy cord tethers each balloon to the box. When the balloons finish inflating, they lift the box and anything in it into the air at a rate of 100 feet (30 m) per minute until it reaches a maximum altitude of 1,000 feet (305 m). The device remains airborne for seven hours. After this time, it loses 100 feet (30 m) of altitude every ten minutes until it lands.

Within 1d10 + 2 days, the wearer’s flesh begins to take on a crystalline appearance in patches. In three times that number of days, her entire body becomes organic crystal, flexible enough to move without hindrance, but hard and cold like crystal. She has +1 to Armor permanently but is no longer capable of sexual reproduction. Further, at the time of complete transformation, she produces a new crystal virus cypher, which can be used by another human. It’s possible to remove the crystal before complete transformation, but it requires surgery and the task difficulty is equal to the cypher level.

    <Level>1d6 + 2</Level>
    <Effect>Explodes in an immediate radius with a grey mist. Living creatures affected in the area begin to transform into plants. Player characters exposed to the mist must attempt three Might defense rolls (any Effort used on one roll is applied to all three). The final result depends on the result of the rolls: No successes: Over the course of ten minutes, the character’s flesh turns green and begins to sprout shoots. He permanently turns into a human-shaped plant. One success: Over the course of ten minutes, the character’s flesh turns green and begins to sprout shoots. Her body stiffens and she cannot move for 28 hours as she takes root. At the end of that time, she becomes a humanshaped plant. However, if someone keeps her from taking root, she returns to normal over the course of another 28 hours, during which time she can take no actions. Two successes: Over the course of ten minutes, the character’s flesh turns green and begins to sprout shoots. This is a painful process. At the ten-minute mark, he moves one step down the damage track, and he remains that way until he returns to normal 28 hours later. Three successes: The character is not affected at all. NPCs in the area who are one level lower than the cypher are affected as if they had two successes. NPCs who are two or three levels lower are affected as if they had one success. NPCs who are four or more levels lower than the cypher are affected as if they had no successes. All plants in the area gain a permanent +1 level boost.</Effect>

        <Result>The device now also inflicts 4 points of damage if used on a target other than the user. If the device already inflicts damage, the damage is increased by 2 points. If used on an artifact, this effect lasts for 28 hours after the first use.</Result>

        <Roll>02</Roll>
        <Result>The device, when activated, also projects a force field around the user that lasts for an hour. This field provides +2 to Armor. If the device already creates protective Armor, that Armor gains +1 instead. This functions once, regardless of whether the enhanced device is a cypher or an artifact.</Result>
      </Row>
      <Row>
        <Roll>03</Roll>
        <Result>The device, when activated, also adds 1 to the user’s Might Edge, Speed Edge, and Intellect Edge for one hour. This functions once, regardless of whether the enhanced device is a cypher or an artifact.</Result>
      </Row>
      <Row>
        <Roll>04</Roll>
        <Result>If the device has immediate range, the range is increased to short. If short, it is increased to long. If long, it is increased to 200 feet (61 m). Such changes to the device last for 28 hours. If the device does not have a ranged effect, it instead affects the user when activated so that the user moves a long distance on an action for 28 hours. This latter effect can be used once.</Result>
      </Row>
      <Row>
        <Roll>05</Roll>
        <Result>The device, when activated, also makes the user invisible for an hour. While invisible the user is specialized in stealth and Speed defense tasks. This effect ends if he does something to reveal his presence or position—attacking, performing an esotery, using an ability, and so on. If this occurs, he can regain the remaining invisibility effect by taking an action to focus on hiding his position. This functions once, regardless of whether the enhanced device is a cypher or an artifact. 06 The device now also restores a total of 4 points each time it is activated. The user can allocate those points among his stat Pools as desired, but the Pools cannot go above their maximum. If the device already restores points to Pools, it restores 2 additional points. If used on an artifact, this effect lasts for 28 hours after the first use.</Result>

    <Effect>To activate this device, the user must place a few drops of blood, strands of hair, nail clippings, or a piece of flesh in a sealed, water-filled tank with one of the headbands and wear the other one. The headband in the tank facilitates the rapid growth of a clone in one month. The clone is a fully grown creature, identical in every physical way to the user. However, it has no consciousness and remains in a comatose state in the tank. Once the clone has matured, if at any time the user dies while wearing the headband, her consciousness is transferred into the clone, regardless of distance. All skills, abilities, and knowledge are transferred. The user does not need to wear the headband throughout the process (if, for example, she is worried about her cypher limit)—just at the beginning to spur the clone’s growth. However, if she dies while not wearing the headband, no transfer occurs.</Effect>

The user cannot penetrate the bubble, and neither can forces from the outside. Not even ambient damage gets through. Dealing at least 50 points of damage to the bubble (which has no Armor) destroys it. Damaging the bubble does not harm the user inside until the bubble is destroyed, at which point he falls from whatever height the bubble was at, which is at least 1 foot (0.3 m) in the air.</Effect>

The user can give the device specific directions to travel to a place within 3 miles (5 km) of where it was activated. The cypher follows the directions it was given, exactly as they were given, until it can travel no farther or it arrives at its destination. There, it waits for one hour, recording everything it sees and hears. At the end of this time, the cypher flies back to where it received the instructions and plays back the recording by projecting the images it witnessed onto a flat surface and playing the audio through the speakers in its body.

The blades function as a propeller and lift the user into the air. She can control the direction of the movement by using the poles to either side. The device allows her to fly by making a Speed roll (level 2) each round. She can fly a short distance each round in combat or about 1 mile (2 km) each minute.

(If not applicable, the default limb is a long, sinewy arm with a three-fingered hand.) The foam arm hardens to the consistency of the creature’s flesh and can be used by the creature as if it were its own. The new arm does not grant the creature additional actions or attacks in a round, but it can be useful for carrying things. If the arm is harmed, the creature suffers no ill effect.

Rather, the user controls both forms, but only one at a time. Switching consciousness between forms is an action. While the user’s consciousness focuses on one form, the other stands motionless. The duplicate moves at the same speed as the user’s normal form, but there is no limit to how far apart the two can be. The duplicate is ghostly and translucent. It can pass through solid matter and cannot be harmed except by special transdimensional weapons and effects. It likewise cannot affect normal matter in any way. While moving as the incorporeal duplicate, the user gains an asset for all stealth tasks. When the duplicate’s duration ends (or it is somehow destroyed), the user’s mind returns to his normal body. If the normal body is slain, the user stays in the duplicate, but only for the remaining duration.</Effect>

    <Effect>When activated, this cypher generates a bolt of wild electricity that extends to short range before arcing into the ground or a target on the ground chosen by the user. The bolt inflicts damage equal to the cypher level, but the jolter is difficult to aim or control. The difficulty for any attack with the device is increased by one step, and a roll of 1 or 2 on the die suggests that a different target (if any) was struck. The jolter emits the bolt for four rounds, each round inflicting the same damage, but using it each round is an action and requires a new roll. There is no way to turn the jolter off once activated, so activating it is a four-round commitment. A user that does not control a jolter in a round will be struck by the bolt of electricity herself.</Effect>

The opening appears to be a normal pocket, but it can stretch to permit entry by an object capable of fitting into the extradimensional space. Placing an object in the space causes the pocket to shut until the user takes an action to open it. While the pocket holds an object, it cannot be opened by anyone except the person who placed the object inside it. Anyone inspecting the clothing finds no sign that the pocket or object exists. Furthermore, the clothing’s weight is unchanged regardless of the weight of the object placed in the pocket. When the user removes the object from the pocket, the pocket closes behind it and the space collapses.</Effect>

With the cylinder, the user locates a random ultraterrestrial being (whose level is equal to or less than the cypher level) dwelling somewhere other than the Ninth World. The being becomes visible in the lens. On the next action, the user can use the staff to open a portal and pull the ultraterrestrial into this world. The ultraterrestrial cannot resist, but once it arrives, it is not automatically compelled to do anything. Unless it can return under its own power or through some other means, it is in this world to stay.When the user finds an ultraterrestrial in the first step of this process, he can choose not to bring it into this world, but he cannot use the device to find another being.</Effect>

Possible categories might include (but are not limited to): metal, vapor, water, mammals, synth, weapons, numenera, the color blue, and plants. It’s worth noting that this does not grant the victim X-ray vision.

    <Name>Wish Disk</Name>
    <Level>10</Level>
    <Effect>The user states a change in reality that she wishes to have happen, and it—or something very like it—occurs. This warping of reality can affect matter, energy, and time. Objects can be created or destroyed, creatures can be slain, and events from the past can be undone. Reality can be altered so that dead beings are still alive (because they never died). However, the minds of most users are insufficient to fully comprehend the vast implications of the reality they change. This means that the wish fulfillment may not be entirely what they thought it would be. The repercussions are too varied to list, but here are a few examples: • A complex object created is brittle, of poor quality, or made of a substance that turns out to be dangerous. • A significant change to the past results in a “bubble” of space-time in which the change occurred, trapping the user in a sort of limited closed dimension, even while normal, unchanged reality continues outside the bubble. • Creatures altered by the change develop health issues ranging from new allergies or minor ailments to cancer or mutations. • Minds altered by the change suffer from long-term trauma, confusion, memory loss, or brain damage. Using a wish disk is taxing. The user moves two steps down the damage track. Sometimes, a PC’s use of a wish disk should work as expected. If it is simple, straightforward, and not outlandish in power or scope, reality is changed without repercussions. Negative aftereffects, as suggested, might come as the result of a GM intrusion.</Effect>

If the creature is hit by the powder, and its level is equal to or lower than the cypher level, it becomes stunned for one minute. During this time, if the user speaks to the target in a language the target can understand, she can implant a suggestion in the target’s mind. This suggestion is a course of activity the target must follow under the specific conditions the user describes. The course of activity can be anything she chooses, though it cannot be anything that poses a significant risk to the target’s life, property, or loved ones. The conditions can be as general or as specific as the user decides. If the described conditions happen during the next 28 hours, the target behaves as instructed.</Effect>
