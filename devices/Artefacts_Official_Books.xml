    <Name>Armored Flesh</Name>
    <Level>1d6 + 2</Level>
    <Effect>When placed on the wearer’s flesh, the armor grafts on permanently. It provides Armor equal to half its level (round up) but does not hinder movement or tire the wearer in any way (no Speed cost increase for applying Effort). On the contrary, the wearer’s maximum Might Pool is permanently increased by 2. However, the benefts come at a cost. Fibrous tendrils extend into the wearer’s flesh and eventually reach the spine and brain, inflicting damage in the form of 2 points of permanent maximum Intellect Pool reduction. This process takes one week. The lost points cannot be regained.</Effect>

    <Name>Battle Armor</Name>
    <Level>1d6 + 4</Level>
    <Effect>This armor is far hardier yet somewhat lighter than Ninth World smithing techniques could ever manage with steel. It is heavy armor but grants an additional +2 Armor (+3 Armor if the artifact is level 9 or higher) in addition to the 3 Armor that heavy armor usually provides. Further, it is entirely sealed and has its own eternally renewed internal atmosphere, which completely protects against poison gases and allows the wearer to operate in an airless environment. The suit’s Armor rating also applies to damage that often isn’t reduced by typical armor, such as heat or cold damage (but not Intellect damage). Battle armor and battlesuits can be troublesome due to the high Armor totals that a PC can attain. GMs can rule, if they wish, that the Armor rating of these suits degrades over time after sustaining a great deal of damage. (The GM, in fact, can do that with any armor.) Doing so likely comes as part of a GM intrusion.</Effect>

    <Effect>This device comes with a small module that can be worn on a belt. Rolling along on its wheels, the chest attempts to follow within immediate range of the module (though it can be directed to remain where it is). It moves a short distance each round. The chest can come to the module from a range of up to 10 miles (16 km) away (20 miles [32 km] if the artifact is level 6 or higher). The interior of the chest is mostly hollow and can hold up to 5,000 pounds (2,300 kg). The artifact must be newly activated each day.</Effect>

    <Effect>This device emits a faint short-range beam that affects only organic creatures and materials. Living targets hit by the beam move one step down the damage track. Nonliving organic targets are likely destroyed. This device is a rapid-fire weapon and thus can be used with the Spray or Arc Spray abilities that some characters have, but each “round of ammo” used or each additional target selected requires an additional depletion roll.</Effect>

Floating along, the automaton attempts to follow within immediate range of the module (though it can be directed to remain where it is). It moves a short distance each round. The sphere can come to the module from a range of up to 10 miles (16 km) away. If the module is worn by an organic creature and that creature takes damage, the automaton moves to repair the damage with cellular regenerating tools that restore 1d6 – 2 points per round (meaning that if a 1 or 2 is rolled, no damage is repaired that round). This requires no action on the part of the creature being healed. Each day, the automaton can attempt to render aid a number of times equal to its level. The artifact must be newly activated each day.</Effect>

    <Effect>This armor is far hardier yet somewhat lighter than Ninth World smithing techniques could ever manage with steel. It is heavy armor but grants an additional +2 to Armor in addition to the 3 Armor that heavy armor usually provides. Further, when activated, it shifts the wearer’s phase randomly for ten minutes (one hour if the artifact is level 9 or higher), which hinders attacks on the wearer by two steps. This shifting effect is negated by special multidimensional weapons or attacks.</Effect>

    <Name>Disruption Blade</Name>
    <Level>1d6 + 1</Level>
    <Effect>This weapon functions as a normal sword (or, rarely, an axe or a cleaver). However, if the wielder uses an action to activate it, the weapon radiates a field of molecular disrupting energy for one round. During that round, if it scores a hit, it inflicts an additional 10 points of damage. If the artifact is level 6 or higher, it is an asset on the attack roll.</Effect>

    <Level>1d6 + 1</Level>
    <Effect>This spear functions as a normal spear. If the wielder uses it to attack a foe, upon a successful hit the wielder decides whether to activate the weapon. Upon activation, the wielder lets go of the spear and it drills into the foe, inflicting an additional 3 points of damage (5 points if the artifact is level 6 or higher). However, the wielder then is no longer holding the spear. The drilling function works only in melee combat because activation occurs after the foe is struck.</Effect>

For example, approaching enemies look like threatening, amorphous creatures, and dangerous weather might look like lightning bolts coming from a cloud. At artifact level 8 and higher, the warnings come earlier and the images more accurately represent the threat. The GM decides when and how the staff warns of danger. For inexplicable reasons, sometimes it fails to deliver a warning. (Thus, it’s all right if the GM forgets about the staff occasionally.)</Effect>

    <Effect>This device fires a cable with a powerful magnet up to long range. When the magnet strikes a metal surface, it affixes itself, and the taut cable extends into a narrow bridge about 3 feet (1 m) wide. The device can then be affixed to another metallic surface to anchor the bridge. The bridge can support 1,000 pounds (450 kg), or 2,000 pounds (900 kg) if the artifact is level 6 or higher. When deactivated, the magnets let go and the cable retracts. An instant bridge could, in theory, be used to grab a metallic object and pull it toward the user. The object would need to weigh less than the user. The action would also be hindered by two steps because the device is not meant for such precision work.</Effect>

In each case, the needles can affect anyone within long range (very long range if the artifact is level 5 or higher). The needles can be poisoned, in which case even those who don’t take damage must make Might defense rolls to avoid being poisoned. This device is a rapid-fire weapon, and thus can be used with the Spray or Arc Spray abilities that some characters have, ignoring “rounds of ammo” costs and not requiring additional depletion rolls for using it as a rapid-fire weapon.</Effect>

First, the cypher is added to the device (an Intellect task with a difficulty of 4), and then various wires and plates are affixed permanently to something—a nearby surface, door, hinge, and so on. When the trap is triggered, the cypher is activated, so people often use straightforward cyphers such as a detonation, a ray emitter, or a similar device. The trigger can react to a specified movement within 3 feet (1 m)—a door opening, a creature or object moving past the artifact, and so on. The higher the level of the device, the more sophisticated the trigger. For example, a level 4 artifact’s trigger might be based on a creature’s size or weight, a level 5 artifact can trigger based on a specific type of creature, and a level 6 artifact can trigger based on recognizing an individual creature.</Effect>

    <Effect>Using this device always takes at least two rounds because producing an effect requires that the user solve a newly generated cognitive puzzle by successfully manipulating the device’s controls, rotational planes, and other hidden inputs. Solving the puzzle is an Intellect task with a difficulty equal to the artifact’s level. If successful, the user is injected with the knowledge of a random numenera plan whose level is up to the level of the artifact. If the user fails the cognition test, they suffer 4 points of Intellect damage (but do not trigger a depletion roll).</Effect>

    <Effect>Holographic images flicker to life on the screen, showing the user in a situation that has never happened in this reality and that probably never will. With some study and experimentation, the user deduces that the images represent outcomes that would’ve occurred except for some decision the user made in the past that set them on their current course. Once that is understood, the user can attempt to use the device to explore a range of different hypothetical strategies for attempting to deal with a particular issue or problem and see how each might play out. Using the viewer eases the difficulty of a numenera crafting task, a salvage task, a negotiation that takes course over several days, or long-term play rolls that might be required to achieve success.</Effect>

Up to 150,000 gallons (568,000 l) can be transferred during a one-day activation period. If smartly deployed during a ranked flooding event (so that the output end drains someplace where it won’t just flow back), the rank of the flood is decreased by 2. A community looking for a new source of water could potentially use a faraway aquifer or other water source by dropping half of a liquid transfer orb into it.</Effect>

    <Effect>This device projects either one or two needles up to long range each time it is used. The needles are far thinner than a human hair, and they inflict no damage. Instead, if one needle is fired, it will calm a belligerent, raging, or attacking creature so that they become calm for at least one minute or until they are attacked. If two needles are fired, the target falls asleep for up to a minute or until they are damaged. The needles can penetrate (ignore) up to 4 Armor. A pacifying needler can be activated to fire all its needles at once on a countdown timer, creating a detonation-like blast that can affect all creatures in line of sight within long range. This depletes and destroys the artifact. If deployed against a ranked horde or community during a conflict in this fashion, the horde or attacking community inflicts 3 less points of damage during that community action.</Effect>

When activated, this device can affect an area up to a very long distance across for one hour. Within that area, all tasks relying on psychic effects, such as telepathy and psychokinesis, whose level is equal to or less than the artifact’s are hindered by two steps, and higher-level psychic tasks are hindered by one step. This means that routine tasks like telepathy are no longer routine, and those that require a roll to succeed, such as an Onslaught mindslice, become even more difficult. If deployed within a ranked community or horde, psychic attacks that would inflict damage to the community during one community action are treated as if 1 level lower.</Effect>

Only those within 3 feet (1 m) of the device are unaffected. During all rounds of shaking, tasks that require movement or balance (including attacks) are hindered.

    <Effect>When activated, this ball liquefires and coats the body of the user for one hour, appearing to be a dark blue bodysuit veined with pathways of soft light. Demonflesh confers two abilities. First, the wearer can become invisible. While invisible, she is specialized in stealth and Speed defense tasks. This effect ends if she does something to reveal her presence or position—attacking, performing an esotery, using an ability, moving a large object, and so on. If this occurs, she can regain the remaining invisibility effect by taking an action to focus on hiding his position. Second, the demonflesh wearer can inflict 3 points of damage with a touch. This attack ignores Armor as it breaks down molecular bonds, disintegrating anything that comes in contact with it. Demonflesh was so named long ago because those who discovered it believed that it was the creation of evil gods and was itself inherently evil. A few people still believe this.</Effect>

    <Level>1d6</Level>
    <Effect>Unlike a mechanical arm, this cybernetic limb is meant to be affixed to a position on a host body that would not normally have such a limb. This, then, could be seen as an additional arm. The arm must be surgically and permanently attached (a task equal to the artifact level). The procedure takes about an hour in a skilled chiurgeon’s hands. Once the arm is attached, the user has complete control over the limb and uses it naturally, which might end up allowing her to hold an additional object. She is granted an asset for all lifting tasks, but the extra arm does not confer additional actions. Extraneous limbs are often found in groups. Thus, a creature that would normally have two arms might have four or six. In addition, they often have mechanical arms or legs, so a creature that normally has two legs might have six, and all of them are cybernetic (and just as often, inappropriate in size, shape, and configuration for that creature).</Effect>

When activated, the tube fires the orb to a distance of 1 mile (2 km) in whatever direction it is facing. Provided the orb does not encounter a solid surface en route to its destination, once it moves the full distance, it stops and captures a perfect image of everything it can see within 5 miles (8 km). It then slowly floats to the ground, where it can be retrieved. Placing the orb into the tube after it has been retrieved allows a user to see the image on the viewscreen. The device is typically used to create a detailed map of the surrounding environment. When fired, if the orb strikes a solid object in its path, it inflicts damage equal to the artifact level and immediately shatters, rendering the artifact worthless.</Effect>

The trick to using a fabricator is knowing what raw materials are needed. Something as complex as a cypher or an artifact requires a task involving knowledge of the numenera with a difficulty of the device level + 4.

    <Level>1d6 + 2</Level>
    <Effect>This long-range weapon fires a beam of gravitons that inflicts no damage. Whatever object or creature the beam hits emits a powerful gravity field that extends out to 30 feet (9 m) in all directions. Anything in the area “falls” toward the target unless it is fixed in place. A falling creature or object takes damage based on the distance it fell as normal when it strikes the target or another solid object in the way. Each creature or object struck by a falling object takes half the damage sustained from the fall. A creature flying through the area is unaffected provided that it continues flying. For attacks using projectile weapons in which the projectile passes through the affected area, the GM may increase the difficulty of the attack by one step. The weird gravity lasts until the end of the next round. Until then, any creature in the affected area functions as if gravity pointed to the target. The target cannot move until this effect ends.</Effect>

    <Effect>This device projects a tiny dart made of glowing metal up to long range. The dart inflicts 1 point of damage and then saturates the target with radiation. The target takes 1 point of ambient damage each round, and the difficulty of all tasks it performs is modified by one step to its detriment. If the target removes the dart, the effect ends after 28 hours. This device is a rapid-fire weapon and thus can be used with the Spray or Arc Spray abilities that some glaives and jacks have, but each round of ammo used or each additional target selected requires an additional depletion roll.</Effect>

The entire scene must fit inside a 100-foot (30 m) cube. The images are made from solidified light and look and feel completely real. The device also creates sounds to make the images seem real. If the images include creatures, those creatures look and act like real creatures, but when they talk, they speak in gibberish. The only quality the device cannot produce is smell—nothing created by the device has an odor. The images last for one hour or until the device is deactivated (not an action). If the scene is something that could be harmful (such as a roaring inferno), the device inflicts ambient damage equal to half its level to all creatures within long range. The images cannot conceal terrain features. They can change the features’ general appearance but must incorporate them into the scene. Thus, a pit in the area would still be a pit, though the color might change so that it blends in with the created scene.</Effect>

Once it’s placed, the user can push on the inside of his eye and extend his eyeball out a number of feet equal to the artifact level. Doing this allows him to see around corners, down thin tunnels, and anywhere else he is willing to risk sending his eyeball.</Effect>

    <Effect>When placed on a creature’s head, the helmet inflicts 2 points of damage. If the helmet is activated, it completely erases the creature’s memories and personality, turning the creature into a blank slate, a process that takes about one hour. After this time, the user who activated the device can implant new memories that build the creature’s personality. If used on a character, the character remains at his tier, but he can swap out his type, descriptor, and focus for different ones.</Effect>

    <Name>Photon Transporter</Name>
    <Level>1d6 + 4</Level>
    <Effect>When activated, anything on one of the metal disks instantly transports to the other disk. The device accomplishes this by transforming the item or passenger into light particles and broadcasting them to the second disk. When the particles arrive, the disk reassembles them in their original form. The devices allow instant transport from one disk to the other and back again, regardless of the distance separating them. Photon Transporter GM Intrusion: If a use would deplete the device, there could be a mishap. If the device transports an object, the object disappears. If it transports a creature, something goes horribly wrong and the device inflicts damage equal to the artifact level. This damage ignores Armor. If the creature survives, it gains a random harmful mutation.</Effect>

The pressurized water also contains a scented residue that stays on the skin, which produces an odor that most humans find pleasing. Those who shower for ten minutes (and don’t wipe the scented residue off their skin) find that the difficulty of all actions related to charm, charisma, and persuasion is reduced by one step for one hour, but only when they are dealing with humans.

Snail shells come in many shapes and forms, including frogs with distended stomachs, large flowers with closed buds, and large purple fruit from the Ausren Woods. All secretly hold anywhere from one to four cyphers, and they are designed to seem like simple objects with no apparent purpose other than decorative. Whatever their design, they are still commonly called snail shells.</Effect>

It can’t pick up an object that weighs more than 10 pounds (5 kg) and could never be used to make an effective attack.

    <Effect>This object can be used as a weapon that fires a beam of energy up to long range. The beam always bounces off of inorganic materials but not living tissue or organic materials. Thus, the weapon can be used only against living targets (or an organic nonliving target). However, the beam is harmless unless it ricochets off a surface first. Strangely, the beam never ricochets in the way that a character expects, so attack rolls with the weapon are two steps more difficult than normal. The beam inflicts 7 points of damage. Particularly skilled users discover that if the beam reflects off of more than one surface, the damage increases. For every additional surface, the difficulty increases by one step, but the damage increases by 3 points (maximum 19 points).</Effect>

In other words, for each minute a person spends inside the barrier, about seven days pass outside the barrier. For characters inside the barrier, time passes normally, though the environment outside the barrier may seem quite strange, as time there seems to pass very rapidly. If the artifact is outside, a day passes every 8.5 seconds. To creatures outside the barrier, people within seem frozen, though an extended viewing reveals that they are not in stasis but instead moving very slowly.

    <Effect>Anyone wearing these water skimmers over their regular footwear can stride quickly across liquid surfaces up to 20 feet (6 m) deep without sinking or getting wet. Wearing water skimmers while on land offsets the wearer’s center of gravity, increasing the difficulty of all movementbased actions by one step.</Effect>

    <Level>1d6 + 3</Level>
    <Effect>This vehicle can hold up to four characters and be piloted by someone who makes Intellect rolls (level 2) each round. In combat, the pilot can use an action to move the vehicle a long distance each round. On extended trips, it moves up to 40 miles (64 km) per hour. The vehicle provides a breathable atmosphere for everyone inside, allowing occupants to breathe normally for up to seven hours. The vehicle also sports six lamps on the exterior, one on each corner and two in front. The lamps light everything within a long distance. The pilot can shut off the lights or turn them on (not an action). Although the vehicle can travel over land, it excels underwater and can move through liquids at half its ground speed. The device can descend to depths of 5 miles (8 km). If it goes any deeper, roll for depletion each round, with depletion in this case indicating that the walls buckle and spring leaks.</Effect>

    <Effect>The mount must be surgically and permanently attached (a task equal to the artifact level). The procedure takes about an hour in a skilled chiurgeon’s hands. Once attached, the mount can hold a light or medium weapon, and the user can attack with that weapon as if he was wielding it.</Effect>

    <Effect>Obeying verbal commands, this device will follow the user around, even over difficult terrain. It can create up to three force bubbles at the ends of the rods, which can contain up to 200 pounds (91 kg) of inanimate material or gear. The bubbles are only as large as they need to be to hold whatever they are given. Commanding the device to create or negate a force bubble is an action.</Effect>

    <Name>Whisperer In The Ether</Name>
    <Level>1d6 + 1</Level>
    <Effect>The bearer of this crystal has a direct line of telepathic communication with an immortal, artificial intelligence whose location is unknown (and may not even be relevant or comprehensible). The user can converse with the intelligence on an ongoing basis, but in general, the whisperer can share a useful bit of information, insight, or advice about once every 28 hours. Sometimes, this translates into an asset on one of the user’s actions, as the intelligence suggests the right phrase to make friends with a shopkeeper to get a good deal, the right tools to use while tinkering with a device, or the right place to put a shield to deflect an incoming attack. Sometimes the information is more broad, such as the right road to take to reach the next town or why the abhumans are attacking the caravan. The whisperer’s willingness and ability to converse varies considerably. Sometimes it is quite chatty and offers advice. Other times, it must be convinced, cajoled, or tricked into giving information. Still other times, it is entirely absent for reasons it will not explain. The whisperer’s knowledge base is broad but not omniscient. It cannot see the future, but it can often predict outcomes based on logic. It has little or nothing of use (to a Ninth World inhabitant) to say about the distant past.</Effect>

    <Effect>The user activates the insect by tossing it into the air. On each of the user’s turns, the insect flies a short distance and attacks a target that she chooses. The device inflicts damage equal to half the artifact level. At the end of this time or when the user chooses, the insect flies back to her and attaches itself to one of her limbs.</Effect>

    <Effect>This musical instrument can be played normally, but it has one setting that produces no obviously audible noise. If a tune is played on this setting in any area open to dry wastes, temperate lowlands, or mountains, a pack of 2d6 + 6 broken hounds arrives within a few hours or less at the location where the instrument was played. Once summoned, the broken hounds revert to their normally vicious demeanor.</Effect>

    <Name>Yarrin</Name>
    <Level>1d6 + 1</Level>
    <Effect>The yarrin is a creature with a level equal to the artifact level, and it has 3 health per level and 3 points of Armor. When activated, the yarrin hovers in the air in orbit around the user and becomes invisible. If anyone within immediate distance attacks the user, the yarrin automatically intercepts and absorbs the attack. Assuming the attack does not destroy the yarrin, it immediately becomes visible and begins attacking the assailant with thin beams of energy (one per round) that inflict damage equal to its level. The yarrin fights for one round per artifact level and then deactivates. However, until it intercepts an attack, it continues to hover invisibly, even as the user sleeps. If you permanently combine a yarrin with significant parts from any other automaton cypher or artifact (task difficulty 7), you create an artifact that functions as a yarrin but with +2 to its level and the ability to attack two targets (if two creatures are attacking the user) with its beams as a single action.</Effect>
