Her body stiffens and she cannot move for 28 hours as she takes root. At the end of that time, she becomes a humanshaped plant. However, if someone keeps her from taking root, she returns to normal over the course of another 28 hours, during which time she can take no actions. Two successes: Over the course of ten minutes, the character’s flesh turns green and begins to sprout shoots. This is a painful process. At the ten-minute mark, he moves one step down the damage track, and he remains that way until he returns to normal 28 hours later. Three successes: The character is not affected at all.

    "Effect": "The user states a change in reality that she wishes to have happen, and it—or something very like it—occurs. This warping of reality can affect matter, energy, and time. Objects can be created or destroyed, creatures can be slain, and events from the past can be undone. Reality can be altered so that dead beings are still alive (because they never died). However, the minds of most users are insufficient to fully comprehend the vast implications of the reality they change. This means that the wish fulfillment may not be entirely what they thought it would be. The repercussions are too varied to list, but here are a few examples: • A complex object created is brittle, of poor quality, or made of a substance that turns out to be dangerous. • A significant change to the past results in a “bubble” of space-time in which the change occurred, trapping the user in a sort of limited closed dimension, even while normal, unchanged reality continues outside the bubble. • Creatures altered by the change develop health issues ranging from new allergies or minor ailments to cancer or mutations. • Minds altered by the change suffer from long-term trauma, confusion, memory loss, or brain damage. Using a wish disk is taxing. The user moves two steps down the damage track. Sometimes, a PC’s use of a wish disk should work as expected. If it is simple, straightforward, and not outlandish in power or scope, reality is changed without repercussions. Negative aftereffects, as suggested, might come as the result of a GM intrusion.",

When it detects such things, it indicates their presence with a pattern of lights (visible through the user’s skin), sounds, or vibrations that show the location of the problem and the nature of the threat. The user must make a level 3 Intellect defense roll to correctly interpret the signals (such as “brain parasite,” “lung cancer,” “blood venom,” or “stomach fungus”). The alarm repeats every hour unless the user acknowledges it with a firm tap, and it repeats each day until the threat is ended. Once the graft attaches, the effect is permanent, and this device no longer counts against the number of cyphers that a PC can bear. At level 6 and higher, the graft can also be activated to neutralize an internal threat if it is of a lower level than the cypher, but thereafter the graft works only as a detector, like the lower-level varieties.",

For example, if the user’s hand is out of phase, they could punch an abykos (whether the creature is solid, partially solid, or insubstantial), reach through a solid wall, or pick up an extradimensional object. For cyphers of level 1 to 4, this pandimensional state extends just beyond the user’s flesh (including clothing and armor on that limb, a small object that can be held in a closed fist, and so on). For cyphers of level 5 or higher, the pandimensional field reaches about 6 inches (15 cm) farther, allowing the user to also affect a small weapon or tool held in that limb. A careful user with an extradimensional limb could attack an opponent with a phased weapon, turning the limb and weapon solid at just the right moment to bypass the foe’s Armor, but the attack would be hindered by two steps because the user would be harmed if their flesh turned solid inside the opponent.",

Although this power allows for very fine control (the user can tie or untie laces, activate a specific switch on a cypher, brush their hair, and so on), the limited reach of the field makes it difficult to use it directly as an attack- throwing a dagger with it would generate only as much strength as a short, quick flip with a hand. The user can’t use this telekinesis on their own body. The cloud of nanites lasts for ten minutes per cypher level.

If the ability costs Pool points to use, the character must spend them to activate the ability. If the next higher tier grants more than one ability, the user gains both abilities. If the tier allows a choice of different abilities, randomly determine which one it grants. If the user already has one of the abilities of that tier, the cypher grants the other ability from that tier, or an unselected ability from a lower tier. For example, a tier 2 Nano with the Commands Mental Powers focus who uses a level 3 version of this cypher would gain either the Psychic Burst ability or the Psychic Suggestion ability. If the GM is using alternative focus abilities from chapter 3, those may be options as well for a precognitive focus inducer.
