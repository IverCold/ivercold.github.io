    <Name>Agony Scarab</Name>
    <Level>1d6 + 2</Level>
    <Effect>To activate the device, a user must place the beetle on the bare skin of a living creature. The beetle immediately burrows into the flesh, inflicting 1 point of damage, and travels just under the skin until it lodges at the base of the creature’s spine. Once there, the beetle drills into the creature’s spine to control its nervous system. At the user’s spoken command, the beetle sends horrific pain shooting through the target’s body, and the target becomes stunned and loses his next action. The beetle then releases its hold on the target and tears firee, inflicting 1 point of damage as it emerges through the skin and returns to the user, at which point it becomes dormant once more.</Effect>

The main weapon is a twinned set of ray projectors that can fire up to a range of 500 feet (152 m) and inflict 8 points of damage. The secondary weapon is an emitter that releases a cloud of poisonous gas in an immediate radius. Anyone in the cloud suffers 4 points of damage (ignores Armor). The tank can move and activate one (but not both) of its weapons as a single action. In order to function, the tank must have an occupant, and there is room for only one human inside. The vehicle obeys thought commands from this occupant, who uses her action to give the tank new orders. If no new order is given, the tank continues to obey the previous order.</Effect>

    <Effect>When activated, this ball liquefires and coats the body of the user for one hour, appearing to be a dark blue bodysuit veined with pathways of soft light. Demonflesh confers two abilities. First, the wearer can become invisible. While invisible, she is specialized in stealth and Speed defense tasks. This effect ends if she does something to reveal her presence or position—attacking, performing an esotery, using an ability, moving a large object, and so on. If this occurs, she can regain the remaining invisibility effect by taking an action to focus on hiding his position. Second, the demonflesh wearer can inflict 3 points of damage with a touch. This attack ignores Armor as it breaks down molecular bonds, disintegrating anything that comes in contact with it. Demonflesh was so named long ago because those who discovered it believed that it was the creation of evil gods and was itself inherently evil. A few people still believe this.</Effect>

    <Effect>When the narrow end is pushed into the ground and activated, the top half repeatedly lifts up and slams back into place. This action sends a tremor through the ground. It continues for ten minutes and then stops. If the device operates for the full time, a violent earthquake tears through the area in a 1-mile (2 km) radius. The quake persists for five minutes and causes widespread damage. Buildings made of wood, stone, or brick collapse; walls topple; cliffs crumble; ceilings cave in; some areas of ground rise up; and other areas sink. Characters inside collapsed buildings or beneath a crumbling cliff or falling wall are subject to a crush or huge crush, and they may have to dig themselves firee as the GM decides. A crush inflicts 3 points of damage, and a huge crush deals 6. Furthermore, the force of the quake knocks creatures to the ground and prevents them from standing until the shaking stops.</Effect>

    <Effect>Unlike a mechanical arm, this cybernetic limb is meant to be affixed to a position on a host body that would not normally have such a limb. This, then, could be seen as an additional arm. The arm must be surgically and permanently attached (a task equal to the artifact level). The procedure takes about an hour in a skilled chiurgeon’s hands. Once the arm is attached, the user has complete control over the limb and uses it naturally, which might end up allowing her to hold an additional object. She is granted an asset for all lifting tasks, but the extra arm does not confer additional actions. Extraneous limbs are often found in groups. Thus, a creature that would normally have two arms might have four or six. In addition, they often have mechanical arms or legs, so a creature that normally has two legs might have six, and all of them are cybernetic (and just as often, inappropriate in size, shape, and configuration for that creature).</Effect>

When activated, the tube fires the orb to a distance of 1 mile (2 km) in whatever direction it is facing. Provided the orb does not encounter a solid surface en route to its destination, once it moves the full distance, it stops and captures a perfect image of everything it can see within 5 miles (8 km). It then slowly floats to the ground, where it can be retrieved. Placing the orb into the tube after it has been retrieved allows a user to see the image on the viewscreen. The device is typically used to create a detailed map of the surrounding environment. When fired, if the orb strikes a solid object in its path, it inflicts damage equal to the artifact level and immediately shatters, rendering the artifact worthless.</Effect>

    <Effect>This long-range weapon fires a beam of gravitons that inflicts no damage. Whatever object or creature the beam hits emits a powerful gravity field that extends out to 30 feet (9 m) in all directions. Anything in the area “falls” toward the target unless it is fixed in place. A falling creature or object takes damage based on the distance it fell as normal when it strikes the target or another solid object in the way. Each creature or object struck by a falling object takes half the damage sustained from the fall. A creature flying through the area is unaffected provided that it continues flying. For attacks using projectile weapons in which the projectile passes through the affected area, the GM may increase the difficulty of the attack by one step. The weird gravity lasts until the end of the next round. Until then, any creature in the affected area functions as if gravity pointed to the target.

    <Effect>A wearer can tap the side of the goggles and cause them to emit a pulse of solidified light that travels a long distance. The light inflicts 4 points of damage. If the user gets a major effect on an attack roll using this device, the light inflicts 12 points of damage to the target, and it inflicts 4 points of damage to everything within a short distance of the target. After resolving this effect, roll for depletion again.</Effect>

    <Effect>Activating the device causes it to become a level 1 creature. The creature follows the user wherever it goes, but otherwise does nothing. As a level 1 creature, it has a target number of 3 and has 3 health. If reduced to 0 health, the device is destroyed. The first time a human or humanoid within short range of the creature dies, the creature absorbs the target’s personality, memories, and identity, and transforms to assume the target’s appearance in the prime of its life. In effect, the device becomes the creature. After nine years, the body dissolves into a slick of foul-smelling slime.</Effect>

The entire scene must fit inside a 100-foot (30 m) cube. The images are made from solidified light and look and feel completely real. The device also creates sounds to make the images seem real. If the images include creatures, those creatures look and act like real creatures, but when they talk, they speak in gibberish. The only quality the device cannot produce is smell—nothing created by the device has an odor. The images last for one hour or until the device is deactivated (not an action). If the scene is something that could be harmful (such as a roaring inferno), the device inflicts ambient damage equal to half its level to all creatures within long range. The images cannot conceal terrain features. They can change the features’ general appearance but must incorporate them into the scene.

The device accomplishes this by transforming the item or passenger into light particles and broadcasting them to the second disk. When the particles arrive, the disk reassembles them in their original form. The devices allow instant transport from one disk to the other and back again, regardless of the distance separating them. Photon Transporter GM Intrusion: If a use would deplete the device, there could be a mishap. If the device transports an object, the object disappears. If it transports a creature, something goes horribly wrong and the device inflicts damage equal to the artifact level. This damage ignores Armor.

The pressurized water also contains a scented residue that stays on the skin, which produces an odor that most humans find pleasing. Those who shower for ten minutes (and don’t wipe the scented residue off their skin) find that the difficulty of all actions related to charm, charisma, and persuasion is reduced by one step for one hour, but only when they are dealing with humans. The device takes 28 hours to recharge between uses. When in its box form, the device is sturdy enough to use as a stool or small table.</Effect>

    <Effect>With a quiet sound like a puff of air, this device fires a tiny slug of metal with a range of 200 feet (61 m). It inflicts damage equal to the artifact level, but since the slug phases through inorganic matter, it ignores Armor. In fact, the slug can even pass through walls unhindered, although targeting through a solid wall provides its own challenges. This weapon cannot harm inorganic targets (it passes through them). This device is a rapidfire weapon, and thus can be used with the Spray or Arc Spray abilities that some glaives and jacks have, but each “round of ammo” used or each additional target selected requires an additional depletion roll.</Effect>

Thanks to the specially designed material of the shell, these cyphers do not count against a character’s cypher limit. The metal shell has a built-in lock that requires a spoken password to open (set by the user). It’s very difficult to tell from looking at the shell that it is anything more than a whimsical object. Snail shells come in many shapes and forms, including frogs with distended stomachs, large flowers with closed buds, and large purple fruit from the Ausren Woods. All secretly hold anywhere from one to four cyphers, and they are designed to seem like simple objects with no apparent purpose other than decorative. Whatever their design, they are still commonly called snail shells.</Effect>

    <Effect>This object can be used as a weapon that fires a beam of energy up to long range. The beam always bounces off of inorganic materials but not living tissue or organic materials. Thus, the weapon can be used only against living targets (or an organic nonliving target). However, the beam is harmless unless it ricochets off a surface first. Strangely, the beam never ricochets in the way that a character expects, so attack rolls with the weapon are two steps more difficult than normal. The beam inflicts 7 points of damage. Particularly skilled users discover that if the beam reflects off of more than one surface, the damage increases. For every additional surface, the difficulty increases by one step, but the damage increases by 3 points (maximum 19 points).</Effect>

For characters inside the barrier, time passes normally, though the environment outside the barrier may seem quite strange, as time there seems to pass very rapidly. If the artifact is outside, a day passes every 8.5 seconds.

    <Name>Ultra Armor</Name>
    <Level>1d6 + 4</Level>
    <Effect>This heavy armor provides +5 to Armor rather than +3. It boosts the wearer’s strength and reflexes, increasing her Might Edge and Speed Edge by 1. She inflicts 2 additional points of damage with melee weapons and can jump twice as far as normal. The interior of the suit has its own oxygen, water, food supply, and environmental controls, sustaining the wearer in any environment indefinitely. Depletion of this artifact is not standard. When depletion occurs, it then provides only +4 to Armor. Depletion must continue to be checked. When it occurs again, the Might Edge and Speed Edge bonuses fail, and the damage and jumping boosts are lost. When depletion occurs again, the sustenance and environmental protections break down. When it occurs one last time, the suit then provides only +3 to Armor, but depletion need not be checked ever again, and the suit remains usable heavy armor.</Effect>

    <Effect>This mask has no function unless worn by someone with at least some mechanical components—automatons, characters who Fuse Flesh and Steel, characters with a mech eye or a mechanical arm, and so on. (Simply wearing a mechanical device is not enough—it must be a permanent part of one’s body.) Such characters gain an asset when using their mechanical parts. This means that an allmechanical being like an automaton gains an asset on almost every task.</Effect>

    <Effect>Activating the device causes the two prongs to fire at a target within immediate range. The target takes 1 point of electrocution damage, and if the target’s level is equal to or less than the artifact level, the user takes control of the target for one minute provided that the user and the target are within an immediate distance of each other. If either exceeds this distance, the target regains control of itself.</Effect>

    <Level>1d6 + 3</Level>
    <Effect>This vehicle can hold up to four characters and be piloted by someone who makes Intellect rolls (level 2) each round. In combat, the pilot can use an action to move the vehicle a long distance each round. On extended trips, it moves up to 40 miles (64 km) per hour. The vehicle provides a breathable atmosphere for everyone inside, allowing occupants to breathe normally for up to seven hours. The vehicle also sports six lamps on the exterior, one on each corner and two in front. The lamps light everything within a long distance. The pilot can shut off the lights or turn them on (not an action). Although the vehicle can travel over land, it excels underwater and can move through liquids at half its ground speed. The device can descend to depths of 5 miles (8 km). If it goes any deeper, roll for depletion each round, with depletion in this case indicating that the walls buckle and spring leaks.</Effect>

It can create up to three force bubbles at the ends of the rods, which can contain up to 200 pounds (91 kg) of inanimate material or gear. The bubbles are only as large as they need to be to hold whatever they are given. Commanding the device to create or negate a force bubble is an action.</Effect>

    <Name>Whisperer In The Ether</Name>
    <Level>1d6 + 1</Level>
    <Effect>The bearer of this crystal has a direct line of telepathic communication with an immortal, artificial intelligence whose location is unknown (and may not even be relevant or comprehensible). The user can converse with the intelligence on an ongoing basis, but in general, the whisperer can share a useful bit of information, insight, or advice about once every 28 hours. Sometimes, this translates into an asset on one of the user’s actions, as the intelligence suggests the right phrase to make friends with a shopkeeper to get a good deal, the right tools to use while tinkering with a device, or the right place to put a shield to deflect an incoming attack. Sometimes the information is more broad, such as the right road to take to reach the next town or why the abhumans are attacking the caravan. The whisperer’s willingness and ability to converse varies considerably. Sometimes it is quite chatty and offers advice. Other times, it must be convinced, cajoled, or tricked into giving information. Still other times, it is entirely absent for reasons it will not explain. The whisperer’s knowledge base is broad but not omniscient. It cannot see the future, but it can often predict outcomes based on logic. It has little or nothing of use (to a Ninth World inhabitant) to say about the distant past.</Effect>

If a tune is played on this setting in any area open to dry wastes, temperate lowlands, or mountains, a pack of 2d6 + 6 broken hounds arrives within a few hours or less at the location where the instrument was played. Once summoned, the broken hounds revert to their normally vicious demeanor.</Effect>

    <Name>Yarrin</Name>
    <Level>1d6 + 1</Level>
    <Effect>The yarrin is a creature with a level equal to the artifact level, and it has 3 health per level and 3 points of Armor. When activated, the yarrin hovers in the air in orbit around the user and becomes invisible. If anyone within immediate distance attacks the user, the yarrin automatically intercepts and absorbs the attack. Assuming the attack does not destroy the yarrin, it immediately becomes visible and begins attacking the assailant with thin beams of energy (one per round) that inflict damage equal to its level. The yarrin fights for one round per artifact level and then deactivates. However, until it intercepts an attack, it continues to hover invisibly, even as the user sleeps. If you permanently combine a yarrin with significant parts from any other automaton cypher or artifact (task difficulty 7), you create an artifact that functions as a yarrin but with +2 to its level and the ability to attack two targets (if two creatures are attacking the user) with its beams as a single action.</Effect>
