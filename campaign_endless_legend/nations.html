                        Every movement is an expression of energy. You can harness this kinetic energy and transform it
                        into other kinds of energy. At first, once you absorb energy, you must use it before you can
                        absorb any more. You can use the absorbed energy as a weapon, or you can infuse an object with
                        dangerous energy that is released upon touch. Eventually, you will be able to use the energy for
                        nonviolent purposes, such as healing or invigorating creatures. Glaives often gain the biggest
                        benefit from being energy absorbers, as they are the ones most often being struck in combat, and
                        many of the initial uses of absorbed energy are for combat. However, Wrights can potentially use
                        some of that energy to improve their crafting abilities.
