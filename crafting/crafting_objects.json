The exterior skin is durable but not particularly lifelike - accurate enough that the automaton could pass as a human if clothed appropriately and observed at a long distance. At a short distance, tasks to recognize the servitor as a disguised machine are eased, or eased by two steps at an immediate distance. The level 5 creature has 1 Armor. The servitor has two modes: observation and combat. In observation mode, the servitor can be set to observe an area or group of creatures at a distance (such as by waiting on a nearby roof or across a busy street), watching their actions and noting anything unusual, which it can report to its creator or controller at a later time. If combat mode is activated (as a character's action, usually via voice command), the servitor attacks a selected target until the target flees or is eliminated. The automaton can use simple humanoid equipment like swords, crossbows, and easy-to-use cyphers (such as detonations and ray emitters). If it has to defend itself and doesn't have a weapon, it attacks with its fsts. It can speak and understand one language known by its creator. The plan creates an automaton that looks like a nondescript member of a specifc species (human, varjellen, and so on). Building the servitor with a different appearance (whether changing the skin color, height, facial features, or other cosmetic changes) requires modifying the plan. Depending on the plan and the intended appearance, this sort of Modification might be easy, difficult, or very challenging. For example, modifying a human servitor plan to build a margr automaton is easy, modifying a varjellen servitor plan to build a human automaton is difficult, and modifying a hulking lattimor servitor plan to build a gaunt sathosh automaton is very challenging.",

The tower notifes the holder of the handheld device if it detects unusual motion, behavior associated with attempts at stealth, or attempts at crossing the circumference that haven't been previously cleared by the builder (for example, normal traffic on a road or through a gate would probably be cleared by the builder). The alarm tower could be set to scan for different criteria, such as the appearance of a certain kind of creature or even a specific individual. Such a device modifes a community's rank by +1 for tasks related to perception. The wielder of an alarm tower's control device can cause the tower to emit an audible alarm either manually or as an automatic response to what it is set to watch for.",

A vat warrior is vaguely humanoid and cannot speak, but it understands one language known by the builder of the birthing vat. A vat warrior is loyal to its community and instinctively defends the people who live there. The warrior automatically dies 1d6 + 20 hours after it is birthed. The biomass is used up, modifed and augmented to create the vat warrior. Usually a community puts criminals, slaves, or animals into the intake hatch (multiple smaller creatures can be added at the same time to meet the minimum biomass requirement, creating a vat warrior that is an amalgam of these donor creatures). The vat warrior might have a vague resemblance to the source of its biomass (such as a scar, tattoo, or eyes), but it has no memories or awareness of its prior life. It has only a basic awareness of its community's layout and a programmed psychological conditioning to follow its directives. Communities with a birthing vat normally use it to quickly create strong, loyal defenders whenever the community is threatened.

    "Specifications": "This plan produces a structure in the form of a cube 30 feet (9 m) to a side. One side has an opening connected to a chute, conveyor belt, or hopper. Raw materials (ore, logs, and so on) are fed into the large opening and processed into refined materials that are spit out on the opposite end, with the surplus material discarded out of a side aperture. The machinery works two to five times faster than direct human labor, and in some cases, the only limit to how fast it can process materials is how long it takes to feed more into the intake aperture. Most plans for materials extruders are multipurpose, but a specifc installation must be built to process one type of material. For example, a wright with this plan could build a smelter (to turn ore or scrap metal into ingots or castings), a lumber mill (to turn trees into boards), a glassworks (to turn sand into glass), a brickwork (to turn clay into bricks), or a cotton engine (to separate cotton fibers from the seeds), but they could not use the plan to make an installation that does all of these things. The extruder has multiple settings, allowing the user to determine what form the processed materials appear in. For example, a lumber mill can produce long square beams (useful for constructing buildings), flat panels (for furniture and doors), or round dowels (for axles or reinforcing wooden joints). A smelter can produce ingots, bars, pipes, billets, or slabs. A brickwork can make various sizes of bricks and tiles. Even the surplus material cast aside by the extruder might have additional uses -  sawdust and other debris from a lumber mill can be burned for fuel, slag from a smelter can be ground up and mixed with water to form cement, and so on. Each day the materials extruder is operated at full capacity, it can produce up to 10 units of materials useful for crafting most commonplace objects and structures.",

This growth doubles the internal living volume at frst, though the growth rate falls off over time. The spire interior can maintain air, temperature, and water for up to ten humans at a time, even if the spire is located in a hostile environment such as a desert, an arctic region, underwater, or in the vacuum of space.

The type of beast is chosen on construction. It can't turn a hostile beast into a friendly one, but in general, it makes all wild creatures of this type act domesticated, and domesticated creatures of this type act tame. All tasks to influence, tame, command, persuade, or intimidate creatures of this type are eased within this psychic field. The field doesn't override a beast's training, so a guard seskii within the field is just as effective as one outside the field (the field makes it easier for its handler to deal with, but it is still trained to react aggressively toward intruders, who do not gain the benefts of the field against it). The plan includes a psychic imprint for one particular kind of beast. The plan can be modifed to craft a taming tower that affects a different kind of beast, but doing so requires a living specimen to calibrate the installation or very detailed notes about the mental functioning of the desired creature (which usually requires extensive observation and testing).",

As it ascends, most of the ascender is used up and falls back through the sky, burning up in the atmosphere. Only the pod at the tip goes high enough and fast enough that it reaches equilibrium so that it is constantly falling around the world. The pod has enough air, food, and water to keep its travelers alive for seven days. While in the void, travelers in the pod experience zero gravity. The controls provide the travelers with several navigation possibilities, which include moving to some other vehicle, station, or artifcial location orbiting the Earth or on the moon, a transfer that takes several days to complete. An adaptable airlock provides the possibility of docking without venting air into the void (assuming there is something on the other side of the lock to transfer to). The other navigational option is to cause the pod to descend back to Earth. Pinpointing a specifc location on the surface is difficult. The location where the pod ends up on the planet is imprecise - usually about 10d10 miles away from the intended destination or completely random. Landing, though automated, remains dangerous because of turbulence. The pod's power reserves are used up after a single trip, after which the pod is good for nothing more than salvage.",

This burst of speed requires very smooth terrain (like salt flats or a frozen lake), or the vehicle might flip into the air and crash spectacularly. After each five hours of use, the scream wheeler must rest in the sun for at least one hour before it becomes operational again. One use of the burst of speed counts as one hour of normal driving.

The vehicle is like an overlarge suit, and in that sense, it acts as medium armor, but it has the Speed Edge cost of heavy armor. Its Armor also applies to heat, cold, and radiation damage.",

    "Specifications": "This plan produces a multiwheeled enclosed vehicle of shining synthsteel with wide windows for passengers to look out. The vehicle can carry one driver and up to nine other passengers, each situated at one control surface. The driver can use one control surface to cause the vehicle to move at up to a long distance each round over rough roads or moderately rough terrain but not through impassible terrain or barriers. Each passenger can use their control surfaces to fire an integrated weapon from the vehicle's surface at a target within very long range, inflicting 8 points of damage each. The weapons include two energy ray emitters, two missile launch silos, and two emplacements throwing slugs of pure force. If deployed against a large group of enemies or an enemy community, treat the fully crewed war chariot as a rank 5 rampaging beast with +2 Armor. After each five hours of use, the vehicle must rest in the sun for at least one hour before it becomes operational again.",
