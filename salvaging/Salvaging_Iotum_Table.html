                    detonation cypher. Either way, the 4 units of mimetic gel are used up.<br /> <br /> Can be vaporized
                    to destille glittering points of light - Quantium - which weight is 3 ounces (85g). 3 units in this
                    form can be used to attempt to move the user one round back in time, a difculty 5 Intellect task. On
                    a success, the user can relive the previous round, and even change what action they took. On a
                    failure, the user instead hops forward about a minute. For the user, no time passes, but for
                    everyone else, the user is simply gone for about a minute. Either way, the attempt uses up units.

                    course of ten hours and increases the ability of the structure to withstand harm or be broken by
                    force by 1 level. On a failure, the object or portion of a structure up to 20 feet (6 m) on a side
