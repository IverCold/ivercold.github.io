            <h2><strong>FOLLOWERS</strong></h2>
            <p>
                Player characters have the option to gain
                followers as they advance in tier, as provided
                by type or focus special abilities. Followers do
                not need to be paid, fed, or housed, though
                a character who gains followers can certainly
                make such arrangements if they wish. A
                follower is someone whom a character has
                inspired (or asked) to come work with the
                character for a time, aiding the character in a
                variety of endeavors. A follower puts the PC’s
                interests ahead of, or at least on par with, their
                own.
            </p>
            <p>
                The PC generally makes rolls for their
                follower when the follower takes actions,
                though usually a follower’s modifications
                provide an asset to a specific action taken by
                the PC they follow.
            </p>

            <p><b>Modifications:</b> A follower can help a PC in one
                or more tasks, granting the PC an asset to that
                task. The level of the follower indicates the
                number of different tasks they can help with.
                The tasks that the follower is able to help with
                are predetermined, usually chosen by the PC
                when they gain the follower. A level 2 follower
                who the player determines is a spy could grant
                a PC an asset on two different tasks, such as
                stealth and deception. Followers cannot help
                with tasks that they don’t have modifications
                for; for the purpose of helping, treat the
                follower as if they had inabilities in all nonmodified tasks.
            </p>
            <p>When the follower acts autonomously
                rather than helping the PC, they act like a
                normal NPC that has modifications. Thus, the
                modification increases their effective level for
                the associated task by one step. For example,
                the level 2 spy follower with modifications for
                stealth and deception attempts stealth and
                deception tasks as if they were level 3 and all
                other tasks as level 2.
            </p>

            <p>
                <b>Follower Assets to Combat and Defense:</b> A
                follower cannot grant an asset to a character’s
                attacks or defense until the follower is level
                3 or higher. Even then, the follower can help
                with attacks and defense only if they have a
                modification for that kind of task.
            </p>
            <p>
                Some focus abilities may grant a special
                exception to this rule. For instance, the
                Controls Beasts focus in Numenera Discovery
                grants a level 2 follower (a beast companion)
                with modifications for combat.
            </p>

            <p>
                <b>Follower Level Progression:</b> A follower
                increases in level by 1 each time a PC advances
                two tiers after gaining that follower. When the
                follower gains a level, the PC also chooses the
                task that the follower gains a modification for.
            </p>

            <p><b>Exceptional Follower:</b> When a character gains
                a follower, there’s a small chance that the
                follower will be exceptional in some way, a cut
                above other followers of their kind. The GM
                determines when an exceptional follower is
                found, possibly as an additional reward for
                smart or engaging roleplaying where the PCs
                impress or otherwise positively interact with
                one or more NPCs, some of whom may later
                go on to become one of the PCs’ followers. An
                exceptional follower has the same qualities as
                a regular follower but is 1 level higher.</p>
            <p>
                <b>Pet:</b> Any PC can potentially gain a pet, though
                a pet typically doesn’t provide modifications.
                If a character wants a pet that can do this,
                they must gain the pet through an ability that
                grants followers. On the other hand, a wellcared-for pet grants an asset to a PC’s tasks
                related to achieving peace of mind, finding
                comfort, and resisting loneliness.
