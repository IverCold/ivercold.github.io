            The Ninth World is a dichotomy of past and future,
            of the primitive and the extremely advanced, of limitations and
            limitlessness. Nowhere does this dichotomy
            become more evident than in the tools the
            inhabitants use, the clothing they wear, the
            weapons they wield, and the gear they carry.

            <img src="images\equipment\title-pic.jpg">


            <h3>CURRENCY</h3>
            <p>
                Thanks to the mining and metallurgy of
                the prior worlds, and their ability to create
                anything they wished (or so it seems, anyway),
                no metal is rarer than any other. People in
                the Ninth World have no concept of gold,
                silver, gemstones, or even diamonds as
                being valuable due to their scarcity. Such
                materials are valuable based on their beauty or
                usefulness alone. Most civilized societies use
                generic coins commonly referred to as shins.
            </p>

            <p>
                Shins are usually metal but can be made of
                glass, plastic, or substances that have no name.
                Some are jagged bits of interesting material or
                small, coinlike objects (such as highly decorative
                buttons from a machine), and others are properly
                minted and stamped, with writing and images.
                Some regions of the Ninth World only accept
                coins that were minted in that realm; others
                accept all coins, regardless of origin. This custom
                varies from place to place and society to society.
                In Peek-Esok-Eviet shins are printed from special Oorgolian material.
            </p>

            <h3>ENCUMBRANCE</h3>
            <p>
                Weights of objects are not listed. In fact, it
                would be futile to do so because the weight
                of an object depends on what materials were
                used to make it. An iron axe and a ceramic axe
                weigh different amounts.
            </p>
            <p>
                There’s no need to keep track of how much a
                character carries. If the GM determines that a
                character is carrying too much equipment, the GM
                should either (1) assign a difficulty and ask for a
                Might action, or (2) assign the weight a cost to be
                added to the character’s Speed Effort. Method 1
                is useful when a character wants to carry a single
                heavy object for a limited time—for example,
                moving a hefty iron box out of a ruin and loading
                it onto a cart for transport back to civilization.
                Method 2 works well for long-term encumbrance,
                such as when a character dons a second backpack
                full of machine parts and continues exploring.
                As a guideline for what the Speed Effort penalty
                should be, compare the character’s burden to the
                encumbrance for wearing armor, and assign the
                penalty according to that assessment (1 for light, 2
                for medium, or 3 for heavy).
            </p>

            <h3>EQUIPMENT LISTS AND PRICES</h3>
            <p>
                The items presented in this chapter are general
                examples, not exhaustive lists. Equipment in
                the Ninth World is often much like that found
                in ancient or medieval societies but can be far
                more advanced. For example, a simple tent or
                bedroll might be constructed of synthetic fiber
                that makes it entirely water-resistant as well as
                far lighter and warmer than cloth. A chainmail
                hauberk could be made in whole or in part from
                glassy links that are harder and lighter than steel.
            </p>
            <p>
                It’s worth noting that some Ninth World tools
                and devices would never be found in a medieval
                setting because they’re relics from a previous
                world or were created with knowledge salvaged
                from a previous world. Examples of these kinds
                of objects are ink pens, clothing made from
                denim or spandex, liquid soap, screw-top metal
                canisters, rubber gloves, umbrellas, sticky tape,
                nylon fishing line, spray bottles, and a hundred
                more similar items. They also include the
                objects listed under Special Equipment, as well
                as random oddities and occasional cyphers and
                artifacts—although finding either of the latter
                for sale like ordinary goods is quite uncommon.
            </p>
            <p>For starting characters there is price limit:
                5 shins on starting weapons and
                15 shins on starting armor.
                If a player doesn’t select a free
                weapon or armor they are entitled to, those are
                the amounts they should get as compensation.
            </p>

            <h3>ARMOR</h3>
            <p>
                Characters expecting danger frequently
                wear armor. Even the simplest of protective
                coverings helps against slingstones and
                sword-strokes, and more sophisticated or
                heavier armor protects against graver threats.
            </p>
            <p>
                You can wear only one type of armor at a
                time—you cannot wear chainmail hauberk
                and scale armor, for example. However, Armor
                bonuses from multiple sources combine to
                provide a total Armor rating. For example, if
                you have subdermal implants that give you
                +1 Armor, a force field that offers another +1
                Armor, and beastskin armor that grants +2
                Armor, you have a total of 4 Armor.
            </p>

            <img src="images/equipment/armor-table.jpg" class="center" />


            <b>USING ARMOR</b>
            <p>
                Anyone can wear any armor, but it can be
                taxing. Wearing armor increases the cost of
                using Speed Effort (see the table). So if you’re
                wearing light armor and want to use two levels
                of Effort on a Speed-based roll to run across
                difficult terrain, it costs 7 points from your
                Speed Pool rather than 5 (3 for the first level
                of Effort, plus 2 for the second level of Effort,
                plus 1 per level for wearing light armor). Edge
                reduces the overall cost as normal.
                Glaives and Jacks have abilities that reduce
                the cost of wearing armor
            </p>

            <h3>WEAPONS</h3>
            <p>
                Not all characters are familiar with all weapons.
                Glaives know their way around most types. Jacks
                prefer light or medium weapons and have an
                inability with heavy weapons. Nanos usually
                stick to light weapons and have an inability with
                medium and heavy weapons. (See the chart on
                page 96 for additional details on weapons).
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Light weapons</b> inflict only 2 points of
                damage, but they ease the attack roll because
                they are fast and easy to use. Light weapons are
                punches, kicks, knives, handaxes, darts, and
                so on. Weapons that are particularly small are
                light weapons.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Medium weapons</b> inflict 4 points of damage.
                Medium weapons include broadswords,
                battleaxes, maces, crossbows, spears, and so
                on. Most weapons are medium. Anything that
                could be used in one hand (even if it’s often
                used in two hands, such as a quarterstaff or
                spear) is a medium weapon.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Heavy weapons</b> inflict 6 points of damage,
                and you must use two hands to attack with
                them. Heavy weapons are huge swords, great
                hammers, massive axes, halberds, heavy
                crossbows, and so on. Anything that must be
                used in two hands is a heavy weapon.
            </p>

                <b>Crank Crossbow:</b> This long-range weapon
                is similar to a standard crossbow, but it has a
                magazine that holds five bolts, requiring a small
                crank to advance to the next bolt. Action to
                reload. It can be used as a rapid-fire weapon.

            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Razor ring:</b> This short-range weapon is just
                what it sounds like: a ring with a razor-sharp
                outer edge. The inner edge is often padded for
                holding.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Sisk:</b> This solid, bladed throwing disk is
                about the diameter of a human head. This

                the warriors of Milave.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Verred:</b> This weapon resembles a sword with
                two forked blades. It is short and useful in
                defense as well as offense.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Yulk:</b> This weapon resembles a splayed
                metal claw mounted on a 2-foot (60 cm) haft.
                It is used mainly by raiders and wildmen of the
                Beyond.

            <h3>SPECIAL EQUIPMENT</h3>
            Nothing on the special equipment list is regularly manufactured by Ninth
            World crafters. Most likely, these items are
            recovered from old sites, but they’re found
            often enough and in large enough quantities
            that many communities offer them for sale.
            The GM is the final arbiter of whether or not
            the characters can obtain these items, but as a
            general rule, common special items are always
            available, rare special items are available 50
            percent of the time, and very rare special items
            are available 25 percent of the time.

            <p>
                <b>Brilliance Cloth:</b> This synthcloth obeys the
                thoughts of anyone touching it. It has the
                ability to slowly change shape and color (but
                not consistency). A major change requires
                about ten minutes. A garment of brilliance
                cloth can be made into any other garment, for
                example, but it can’t be made protective.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Floatstone:</b> A piece of rock, usually about
                the size of a brick, that pulls against gravity.
                Most people think of it as having a “negative
                weight” of about –10 pounds. Thus, if attached
                to anything lighter, it floats away.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Glowglobe:</b> This device illuminates
                everything in short range with soft light. It can
                hover in place on its own, or it can be attached
                to something. The minor glowglobe lasts for
                an hour when activated. The major glowglobe
                functions continuously.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Memory Ants:</b> This is a small jar of tiny insects
                that run across a page of text and then return
                to the jar. When spilled out again and given
                ink, they replicate the text once and then die.

                <b>Shaper Key:</b> A shaper key is a wad of putty that
                can be inserted into a conventional lock. It takes
                on the form of the key for that lock and then
                hardens, permanently, into a functional key.

                <b>Shock Ring:</b> This weapon is a razor ring with
                a charged outer edge that inflicts 4 additional
                points of damage. If it misses, it returns
                unerringly to the thrower’s hand. Its power is
                normally never depleted.

                <b>Sprayflesh:</b> This tiny synth canister sprays
                out a sticky gelatin that covers and seals
                wounds instantly. Its use restores 6 points to a
                character’s Might Pool.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Spraymetal:</b> Similar to sprayflesh, but
                instead of restoring flesh, it repairs minor
                damage (breaks, tears, and holes) in any
                simple object—even a flexible object like cloth
                or a leather bag—but not devices or anything
                as complex as a crossbow. It has the strength
                of steel.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Stingcharge:</b> This handheld weapon fires an
                electrical bolt that inflicts 3 points of damage
                at immediate range and 2 points of damage at
                short range. It cannot be made to fire farther
                than that. A stingcharge can be used as a
                rapid-fire weapon. Its power is normally never
                depleted.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Whisperlock:</b> This is similar to a padlock,
                made of powerful synthsteel or stronglass,
                except that it has no keyhole. It opens with a
                secret word selected when it is initially locked.
                The word must be spoken into the lock itself.
