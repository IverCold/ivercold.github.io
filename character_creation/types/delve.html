            <p>
                Delves are willing to risk everything just to find
                something new, something that no one else
                has seen before. They are driven to expand the
                boundaries of the known, often rediscovering
                what was long forgotten. Delves delight in
                finding never-explored ruins of the prior worlds
                and cataloguing them from top to bottom.
                Mysteries presented by weird machines and
                broken scrap are nearly identical for Delves.
                They know that what others dismiss as debris
                might contain hidden treasure called iotum—
                like apt clay, protomatter, philosophine, data
                orbs, and more! That’s what most Delves seek.
                They won’t ignore cyphers and artifacts prized
                by others, of course, but Delves see deeper
                and are skilled at extracting the building blocks
                of the prior worlds.
            </p>
            <p>
                As with other kinds of explorers, Delves
                are rare. Most people in the Ninth World
                would rather gnaw off a hand than risk the
                horrors that often lie within ruins or even just
                over the next hill. But without Delves, who
                would bring back the special components
                that some crafters have come to depend on?
                Delves aren’t fools; they take precautions, and
                they’re not immune to fear. But the lure of the
                unknown and the thrill of discovery outweigh
                the risks. Longevity isn’t as important to a
                Delve as discovery.
            </p>
            <p>
                That said, a Delve won’t discover much if
                they don’t have the stamina to push through
                when things get tough. Delves need to be at
                least a little skilled at a lot of things. They need
                Might and Speed to deal with the challenges
                they face, but they need Intellect to help them
                salvage for iotum and other numenera items.
            </p>
            <p>
                To explore inscrutable ruins, Delves have
                to be able to react quickly, squeeze through
                small spaces, and often run away without
                being weighed down by heavy armor. A few
                might choose light armor, though most prefer
                clothes that don’t restrict them at all.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Delves in Society:</b> Delves don’t spend
                much time in society because they’re off
                exploring. When they do come back to a base,
                settlement, or larger community, they are given
                a wide berth by those afraid of the numenera,
                which is often a surprising number of people.
                To commoners, the numenera is as likely to
                help you as it is to kill you, disfigure you, or
                send you hurtling into the void. So Delves
                usually seek the company of other explorers,
                such as Nanos, Jacks, Glaives, and others.
                Delves also seek the acquaintance of Wrights,
                and vice versa, because the iotum that Delves
                prize is equally sought by Wrights to craft
                installations and other wonders.
            </p>
            <p>
                Sometimes Delves deliver objects or
                messages between distant locations, or they
                provide their expertise on travel routes to
                merchants and other explorers. But these are
                usually secondary goals, convenient in that a
                long-distance trip allows them to find more
                previously unexplored locations. Sometimes a
                Delve’s deliveries are delayed while the Delve
                spends an extra week or more investigating
                an abandoned structure or ruin. This can put
                a strain on otherwise cordial relationships
                with Glaives and Nanos, who each see in
                the Delve a bit of themselves. Arkai are least
                likely to want to upend their stay inside newly
                developed communities, but they understand
                the value a Delve associated with a community
                can bring, if the Delve decides to use the
                community as their base.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Delves in the Group:</b> A Delve isn’t so much
                a leader as a scout, though some Delves do
                naturally step into the role of directing a group,
                since they’re often the ones who can find the
                best route forward. Though they are resilient in
                a fight, they are not front-line defenders; that’s
                obviously a job for a Glaive. They pay attention
                to knowledge provided by Nanos, but they
                know enough about the numenera themselves
                that they don’t need to rely on them. Delves
                may spend long periods of time exploring, but
                many enjoy talking about what they found with
                a small group of friends or allies.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Delves and the Numenera:</b> In many
                ways, the numenera is what draws Delves
                to explore—the numenera and the special
                components that bring the numenera to life.
                But Delves are excited by any discoveries
                related to the numenera, whetting their
                appetite to explore further. Their skills and
                knowledge give them excellent means to find
                and salvage iotum and other valuables from
                otherwise dead ruins.
            </p>
            <p>
                Delves look for items that help them
                improve their ability to search and find out
                information. If a Delve doesn’t know where to
                look, then they’re virtually useless.

            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Advanced Delves:</b> As Delves gain experience
                and become more skilled and powerful,
                they gain abilities to better understand the
                numenera, to tinker with it, and to salvage and
                find new uses for iotum.
            </p>

            <h3>DELVE BACKGROUND</h3>
            <p>
                Lots of people explore, but not all of them are
                Delves. Delves have a special relationship with
                the iotum. Something in your background
                has put you in this position and is at least
                partially responsible for your talents. Choose
                one of the three options described below as
                the source of your skills (or create your own).
                This will provide the foundation of your
                background and give you an idea of
                how you can improve. The GM can
                use this information to develop
                adventures and quests that
                are specific to your character
                and play a role in your
                advancement.
            </p>

            <b>WHAT OTHERS FEAR TO KNOW</b>
            <p>
                Your knowledge of what underlies the
                numenera is a degree beyond what even most
                Aeon Priests and Nanos know. Some see it as
                devilry and ill magic, believing it is knowledge
                that should remain in the ruins of the past.
                Mimetic gel, tamed iron, kaon dots, and even
                data orbs are things that you understand
                because you found them and were taught by
                them in turn. The tamed iron nearly killed
                you because, as you know, it’s a cousin to
                the iron wind. The data orb was almost your
                death, because when you connected it to the
                datasphere, an automaton was dispatched to
                your location as a security measure. But you
                survived and learned yet more in the process.
                In fact, you learned to disassemble both the
                active devices and the long-dead machines of
                the prior worlds in order to salvage that which
                gave them form and substance. This iotum,
                you learned, was a completely new source of
                wonder and knowledge.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Advancement:</b> You must continue to salvage
                iotum. There’s far more to the numenera than
                one person can ever know, but that doesn’t
                mean you shouldn’t try to discover more.
                More secrets, more knowledge, and more
                components mean more power. At some point
                in your career, you might need to find a mentor
                or another data orb willing to give you answers
                to your many questions.
            </p>
            <p>
                When your stats improve or you learn
                new skills, it’s because you have discovered
                another new kind of iotum. When you gain
                a new ability, it’s the result of long hours
                of exploration, salvage, and attempts at
                unlocking new wonders.
            </p>

            <b>PART MACHINE</b>
            <p>
                Is it any wonder you can take apart other
                devices and machines when you’re at least
                half mechanical yourself? Your connection
                with machines is obvious: modules, ports,
                and other strange tech protrudes from your
                skin, hinting at deeper connections beneath.
                Perhaps your skin is shiny or metallic, or
                maybe it has a coating that absorbs light. You
                can find your way deeper into ruins of the
                prior worlds at least partially because you can
                open ways that others can’t with just a touch.
                When you salvage iotum from dead cyphers
                and scrap, you do so by commanding nanites
                through your ports. Your abilities are at least
                partially derived from the hidden devices that
                lace your nervous system. Sometimes, you
                wonder if the components and iotum that you
                salvage from other machines also lie within
                you.
            </p>

            <p>
                How you came to be part machine is a
                story all its own. Were you always like this?
                Did you fall into a ruin and wake up this
                way? Did you undergo surgeries offered by a
                strange entity, taking a chance on becoming
                something more? However it happened, you’re
                not human, and commoners sometimes
                look upon you with fear and suspicion. That’s
                all right, as long as another Delve doesn’t
                look upon you as a potential source for
                components. Sometimes, rather than worry
                about it, you hide your true nature beneath
                concealing garments or a hood.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Advancement:</b> Learning new things helps
                you advance, as do practice and persistence.
                However, it seems your surest way to unlock
                new abilities is to connect yourself to new
                devices uncovered in your explorations.
                Sometimes this leads to dangerous threats,
                but other times, it provides you with a new
                insight or an entirely new ability. Depending on
                how you came to be part machine, you might
                also be open to implanting new, permanent
                devices into your body, which is another route
                to advancement.
            </p>
            <b>MENTOR</b>
            <p>
                You grew up in service to another Delve from
                whom you learned to train your stamina,
                patience, and love for the weird. You were
                taught not to fear things that would make
                most people weak, sick, or outright dead.
                Instead, you cherish them as part of a life
                steeped in discovery. Your mentor taught
                you to love the wilderness, the unknown,
                and places of ancient power, in particular—
                exactly the opposite of how most are raised
                in the Ninth World. After a time, you and
                your mentor parted ways—perhaps due to
                a philosophical disagreement, a scarcity of
                resources, a rare opportunity requiring travel,
                or some kind of tragedy. Sometimes you
                wonder, as you gaze at some new amazing,
                impossible edifice: what would your mentor
                think of this?
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Advancement:</b> To advance, you explore.
                Without your mentor to guide you, it’s just
                you and the world. That said, a part of you will
                never stop yearning to reunite with the one
                who taught you so much. If you do, maybe
                they will unlock an entirely new chapter in
                your advancement. And who knows? Maybe
                the things you’ve learned since you parted will
                have a similarly important effect on them.
            </p>

            <h3>DELVE PLAYER INTRUSIONS</h3>
            <p>
                When playing a Delve, you can spend 1 XP
                to use one of the following player intrusions,
                provided the situation is appropriate and the
                GM agrees.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Fortuitous Malfunction:</b> A trap or a
                dangerous device malfunctions before it can
                affect you.                
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Serendipitous Landmark:</b> Just when it seems
                like the path is lost, or you are, a trail marker,
                landmark, or simply the way the terrain or
                corridor bends, rises, or falls away suggests to
                you the best path forward, at least from this
                point.                
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Weak Strain:</b> The poison or disease turns
                out not to be as debilitating or deadly as it first
                seemed, and inflicts only half the damage that
                it would have otherwise.
