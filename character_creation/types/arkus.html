            <p>
                Arkai are natural leaders of the Ninth World,
                using wit, rhetoric, and the strength of
                working together to overcome problems.
                Heralds, nobles, and pioneers could be Arkai.
                Sometimes warlords, generals, and even
                guardians are Arkai. “Arkus” is common
                vernacular used by humans in the Steadfast
                and the Beyond for any person skilled in
                governing others, but in truth, the word
                applies only to those who are specially gifted
                in leadership. Arkai have the potential to
                spearhead armies, cities, or even entire
                regions, because their abilities surpass
                those who are merely good at running a long
                confidence game.
            </p>
            <p>
                Arkai are usually quite intelligent, but
                being able to survive physical challenges is
                important for anyone exploring or establishing
                new communities in the Ninth World. As a
                result, many Arkai have a high Intellect and
                either Might or Speed as a high secondary
                statistic, depending on whether they like to
                come in strong or to get out of the way of
                threats. When forced to fight, Arkai prefer
                ranged weapons, though they’d rather get
                someone else to fight on their behalf if they
                can’t defuse the situation another way.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Arkai in Society:</b> People who don’t have a
                talent for leadership or who haven’t trained
                long and hard to lead sometimes discount an
                Arkus’s abilities. Without personal experience
                in being an effective leader, it’s easy to assume
                that anyone can do it. In terms of public
                perception, Arkai are at the opposite end of
                the continuum from Nanos. Nanos are viewed
                with suspicion and fear because what they do
                is unknown, but anyone can tell someone else
                what to do. Of course, the secret is that it’s
                incredibly hard to convince people to listen,
                let alone tell someone else the best thing to do
                and not inadvertently lead followers into some
                kind of disaster.
            </p>
            <p>
                Tales of both mighty and disastrous
                leaders are common in the Ninth World, with
                anecdotes of the disastrous (or at least the
                mediocre and bad) ones outnumbering the
                positive by ten to one. That’s because true
                Arkai are relatively rare. Anyone can say they’re
                a leader, and many people do have experience
                in ordering others around. But that experience
                doesn’t necessarily equate to quality.
            </p>
            <p>
                Arkai are almost always found with others—
                peers, at least, if not followers. An Arkus is at
                their best when surrounded by those who can
                help them develop their ideas, turn their goals
                into reality, and improve society in a way that
                the Arkus most values.
            </p>
            <p>
                Some Arkai claim power by showing their
                competence and winning over others. Other
                Arkai rely on their legacy of a noble birth,
                an inheritance, or even claims that they are
                representatives of a god, some ancient and
                dead species, or one that no longer exists
                in the world. These latter claims are appeals
                to authority and can be effective in the short
                term, but only if an Arkus can back up those
                claims with the actual ability to make good
                decisions on behalf of a larger community.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Arkai in the Group:</b> Typically, an Arkus is the
                party member who leads from the rear, as their
                abilities are not directly aggressive. Compared
                to the Glaive or Delve, the Arkus isn’t nearly
                as robust. However, an Arkus is never too far
                away to verbally intercede on the party’s behalf.
                Many of their abilities require that they be able
                to talk to other creatures. This is especially true
                when an Arkus is operating within an allied
                community or horde. When the party needs to
                negotiate with enemies, calm a community, or
                take charge, the Arkus is the one they want.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Arkai and the Numenera:</b> When it comes
                to the numenera, most Arkai are interested in
                items that allow communication across large
                distances or to many people at once, in objects
                that will extend their influence with others, and
                even in items that allow them to know what
                others think and believe. With such knowledge,
                an Arkus can better lead them or at least
                figure out how to gain their allegiance. Arkai
                understand that changing a creature’s mind
                against its will or otherwise compromising
                consent is not the way to build a following over
                time, because reputations are hard to shed
                once tainted by bad behavior.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Advanced Arkai:</b> An Arkus might begin as a
                wide-eyed idealist interested in leading people
                to a better tomorrow, but as they advance,
                they might use their skills to become one
                of the leaders in an allied or newly founded
                community. Their presence helps a community
                be more robust and better able to survive hard
                times. They can rule effectively, because they
                know how other creatures think.
            </p>

            <h3>ARKUS BACKGROUND</h3>
            <p>
                As an Arkus, you have the capacity to
                influence other people and, on a larger scale,
                communities, hordes, and even society itself.
                Something in your background explains
                these unique talents, whether it is genetics,
                enhancements, training, or something else.
                Choose one of those three options described
                below as the source of your skills, knowledge,
                and abilities, or create your own background.
                This choice will provide the foundation of your
                character and give you an idea of how you can
                improve. The game master (GM) can use this
                information to develop adventures and quests
                that are specific to your character and play a
                role in your advancement.
            </p>


            <b>INBORN TRAITS</b>
            <p>
                You were born this way. Everyone always took
                to you. You always seemed to know the right
                thing to say. It all came naturally. Your voice
                was pleasant, your eyes shining and honest,
                and your face attractive. These qualities have
                always been strong enough that you could rely
                on them. While others studied a craft, learned
                to fight or steal, or tinkered with the numenera,
                you found that you could usually get what you
                needed and wanted by talking to people.
            </p>
            <p>
                Now, all this might come from a heritage
                of quality forebears, or it could come from
                something more. A silver-tongued Arkus like
                yourself might have inherited these qualities
                from your family, or you might benefit from
                subtle mutations that alter your voice and
                mannerisms to be perfect for influencing
                others. You don’t really know. You just know that
                you’ve always been this way and that, while you
                look just like everyone else, you’re different. Of
                course, no one ever need know that but you.
            </p>

            <p>
                <b>Advancement:</b> Just as you don’t know the
                ultimate source behind your talents, you don’t
                know their limits either. You have to continually
                test them and push yourself into trying new
                things. You might need to share your secrets
                with someone knowledgeable one day so that
                they can help you. Perhaps you’ll even discover
                the source of your abilities. Regardless, when
                your stats improve and you gain new abilities,
                it’s because you’ve taken the gifts you were
                born with and pushed them to the next level.
            </p>

            <b>ENHANCEMENTS</b>
            <p>
                You might be a leader, but you don’t fit the
                mold. Although you gained your share of
                practical experience in learning how to
                influence others, you have the numenera on
                your side as well. Some of your knowledge of
                rhetoric and ability to speak at an enhanced
                volume is due to biomechanical bits implanted
                in your brain and spine, wired into your nerves
                and muscles. Your vocal cords are woven with
                subtle resonant threads. Subdermal plating
                makes your appearance more symmetrical and
                pleasing. Your facial muscles are interlaced
                with small elements that give you complete
                control over your micro expressions.
            </p>
            <p>
                Alternatively, your genetic code could have
                been rewritten by engineered viruses, or the
                tissues in your body could have been reworked
                by nanotech, turning you into a paragon
                that others are drawn to. Or maybe you’ve
                been altered by strange science—radioactive
                treatments of bizarre energies, chemical
                compounds and drugs, or extradimensional
                enhancements—that makes you smarter and
                more able to see the implications of long-term
                planning than anyone around you.
            </p>
            <p>
                Whatever the case, you’re the result of
                ancient knowledge made manifest in the
                present, and now you’re shaping the future.
                Perhaps your modifications are obvious and
                visible; perhaps they’re not. Regardless, you
                know that you’re more than merely human.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Advancement:</b> Your leadership abilities
                are in some ways predicated on keeping the
                enhancements in your body working well and,
                when possible, improving them. You’re always
                on the lookout for new parts and systems that
                can be incorporated into your body or new
                doses of drugs and supplements to maintain
                your abilities. You might need to seek out
                surgeons, mechanics, or bioenhancement
                specialists to take you to the next level.
                Perhaps the Aeon Priests can help. At some
                point, you might find yourself in need of very
                specific, very rare parts to complete your
                enhancements. Such components might be
                found only in particular ruins of the prior
                worlds, or perhaps they’re available elsewhere
                for a high price. Either way, getting them won’t
                be easy.
            </p>
            <p>
                When you improve your skills and abilities,
                it’s because you’ve altered your enhancements
                in some way. Some of them may even produce
                a more overt effect, modulating your voice and
                further honing your appearance.
            </p>

            <b>TRAINING AND EXPERIENCE</b>
            <p>
                You are eloquent, good-looking, or both, but
                what really separates you from the crowd is
                your training. Perhaps you worked as an intern
                with the Aeon Priests in Qi that work behind
                the scenes to lead the Order of Truth, where
                they taught you how to speak eloquently,
                debate convincingly, and synthesize the best
                plans from all those put forth.
            </p>
            <p>
                You know a thousand different ways to
                argue and influence. You learned how to read
                people to ascertain their moods, distinguish
                their truths from their lies, and determine what
                they want and what they need to hear. You got
                a lot of practice using your skills in public,
                starting small at first but working your way up
                to leading community movements and taking
                charge of short-term community projects.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Advancement:</b> When it comes to leadership,
                meeting with small convocations of your peers
                is always useful; however, there is no teacher
                like actual experience. You will develop some
                of your greatest skills and abilities on your
                own. Perhaps when the time comes, you will
                consider taking on an intern of your own, not
                only to pay back what’s been given to you but
                because through teaching comes discovery.
            </p>

            <h3>ARKUS PLAYER INTRUSIONS</h3>
            <p>
                When playing a Arkus, you can spend 1 XP
                to use one of the following player intrusions,
                provided the situation is appropriate and the
                GM agrees.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Friendly NPC:</b> An NPC you don’t know,
                someone you don’t know that well, or
                someone you know but who hasn’t been
                particularly friendly in the past chooses to
                help you, though doesn’t necessarily explain
                why. Maybe they’ll ask you for a favor in return
                afterward, depending on how much trouble
                they go to.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Perfect Suggestion:</b> A follower or other
                already-friendly NPC suggests a course of
                action with regard to an urgent question,
                problem, or obstacle you’re facing.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Unexpected Gift:</b> An NPC hands you a
                physical gift you were not expecting, one that
                helps put the situation at ease if things seem
                strained, or provides you with a new insight for
                understanding the context of the situation if
                there’s something you’re failing to understand
                or grasp.
