            <p>
                Jacks are intrepid explorers. They are jacks of all
                trades—hence the name—although the word also
                hearkens back to fables involving a wily, resourceful
                hero who always seems to be named Jack. Used as
                a verb, “to jack” means to steal, to deceive, or to
                get out of a tight scrape through ingenuity or luck.
            </p>
            <p>
                Jacks don’t use one skill or tactic exclusively;
                they use whatever weapons, armor, esoteries,
                or anything else might help them. They are
                hunters (particularly treasure hunters), con
                artists, skalds, rogues, scouts, and experts in a
                variety of fields.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Jacks in Society:</b> Jacks are crafters, entertainers,
                leaders, and thieves. They’re architects, engineers,
                con artists, salespeople, and teachers. This
                diversity doesn’t mean that the Jack is the
                archetypal everyman—that kind of simple
                categorization would diminish the character type.
                Jacks are remarkable in that they can do so many
                different things, and some do multiple things. If
                one Jack is an artist and another is an explorer,
                there’s likely a third who is both at once.
            </p>
            <p>
                Skilled and learned Jacks who share their gifts
                with others are prized members of society, well
                respected for what they know and can do. A village
                might be protected by warriors, but it’s the Jack
                who makes everything run smoothly by repairing
                or building whatever is needed, handling disputes,
                investigating mysteries, and so on. On the other
                hand, Jacks who use their varied abilities
                to benefit only themselves are distrusted at
                best and reviled at worst. The murderers and
                thieves of a community are likely Jacks.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Jacks in the Group:</b> Jacks fill in the space
                between the extremes of Nanos and Glaives. They
                frequently do a little of everything and know a little
                of everything. They can fight alongside a Glaive
                or have a scholarly talk with a Nano. There are
                no right or wrong places, actions, or roles for
                Jacks. They can hold their own in combat or
                other dangerous situations, but they excel at many
                assorted tasks like searching for clues, using
                diplomacy with the locals, or repairing a piece of
                broken gear. The drawback, of course, is that Jacks
                are rarely the best fighters in combat or the best
                numenera handlers. They might, however, be the
                best at more specialized skills. They’re the most
                likely characters to know how to climb, how to
                stand watch effectively, how to jimmy a lock, and
                how to jury-rig a makeshift shelter or snare trap.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Jacks and the Numenera:</b> Jacks gravitate
                toward cyphers or artifacts that expand their
                array of options even further. An enhanced
                piece of armor might be fine for a Glaive, but
                many Jacks would rather have an object that
                allows them to communicate at a distance,
                walk through walls, or put foes to sleep.
            </p>

            <p>
                <b>Advanced Jacks:</b> Jacks are the most flexible of
                the character types, and advanced Jacks are no
                different. Some learn esoteries, as Nanos do.
                Others hone their combat abilities. Some Jacks
                do both, gaining more skills and improving at,
                well, a little bit of everything.
            </p>

            <h3>JACK BACKGROUND</h3>
            <p>
                You might hear people say that a Jack is just
                the typical everyman (or everyperson), but
                don’t believe it. You aren’t like anyone else. You
                can do things that no one else can do because
                you do so many things. You’re a warrior, you’re
                a thief, you’re a diplomat, you’re a sage, and
                you’re a spy.
            </p>
            <p>
                When you choose Jack as your character
                type, come up with an explanation for how you
                learned your wide variety of talents. Choose
                one of the three options described below. It
                will provide the foundation of your background
                and give you an idea of how you can improve.
                The GM can use this information to develop
                adventures and quests that are specific to your
                character and play a role in your advancement.
            </p>

            <b>BORN LUCKY</b>
            <p>
                You seem to be better than most people
                because you are. Your ancestors were part
                of a genetic experiment, and your genes are
                superior to those of the average human.
                You’re smarter, stronger, more dexterous, and
                able to learn mental and physical skills more
                quickly. Folks might call you charismatic,
                blessed, divinely gifted, or just plain lucky.
                They probably said the same thing about your
                parents, their parents, and so on. Some of
                your genetic advantage might even grant you
                low-level psychic abilities that greatly resemble
                the “miracles” performed by Nanos.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Advancement:</b> You might be a superhuman,
                but you’re still limited by what you learn and
                experience. Therefore, you must continue to
                train and study. Practice is the key—it just
                comes easier for you than it does for others.
                When you improve, it’s because you have
                honed your natural abilities or unlocked
                heretofore unknown genetic traits.
            </p>

            <b>SCHOOL OF HARD KNOCKS</b>
            <p>
                You learned things the hard way—on your
                own. Adaptive and canny, you express the true
                strengths of humanity in your ability to adjust
                quickly to circumstances, pick up new tricks
                to succeed, and ultimately survive when you
                probably should be dead.
                Most likely, you grew up on your own, perhaps
                on the streets, in the wilderness, or amid
                ruins. The details don’t really matter. What’s
                important is that you taught yourself how to
                overcome whatever challenges came along.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Advancement:</b> Just keep on keeping on. You
                got to where you are by observing, learning,
                adapting, and adopting. To advance, you need
                to do more of the same. Constant wariness
                coupled (somewhat paradoxically) with
                constant curiosity allows you to hone your
                skills and new capabilities.
            </p>

            <b>A COBBLED JUMBLE</b>
            <p>
                You’re the product of generations of eugenics,
                bolstered by minor cybernetic enhancements,
                a few small psychic abilities, and the lessons
                of secret masters. In other words, you don’t
                have one source of power or one explanation
                for your abilities—you have many, and as far
                as you’re concerned, that’s the best formula for
                success. You don’t put all your eggs in a single
                proverbial basket. To really get ahead, you
                must rely on multiple strengths.
            </p>
            <p>
                You’ve always got an unexpected trick up your
                sleeve or a fallback contingency. For example, you
                might have subdermal implants that make you
                more resilient, your training might let you sense
                a foe’s attack before he strikes, and your psychic
                abilities could allow you to push your enemy’s
                blade slightly to the left so you can just barely
                dodge it. In the end, you’re simply hard to hurt.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Advancement:</b> You have chosen every path,
                so you must travel each of them. Training and
                drugs fuel your body and mind, brain implants
                grant you additional skills, and devices hidden in
                your palms give you fresh abilities. Advancement
                means new teachers and technicians, strange
                substances and radiations, and an everincreasing need to discover the secrets of the
                past that will prove essential for your future.
            </p>

            <h3>JACK PLAYER INTRUSIONS</h3>
            <p>
                When playing a Jack, you can spend 1 XP to use
                one of the following player intrusions, provided
                the situation is appropriate and the GM agrees.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Familiar Insight:</b> You know this person (or
                heard about them somewhere) well enough to
                give insight about their motives or intentions
                and how best to convince them to see things
                your way. You know the right words, posturing,
                inflection, amount of emotional manipulation,
                or even what sort of joke or agreeable complaint
                might sway them. This can convince a neutral
                person to take your side, or a hostile one to
                hear you out for a little while longer.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Inspirational Recall:</b> You recall an important
                detail from a previous encounter (perhaps
                something you don’t even remember noticing
                at the time) that suggests a successful course of
                action for your current situation. This might be
                recognizing a password hidden in an innocuous
                code or riddle, realizing you saw a suspicious
                individual near a crime scene, overhearing an
                important conversation between two NPCs, or
                understanding that an NPC’s subtle glance or
                gesture had additional connotations indicating
                what you should do.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Lucky Break:</b> Something unexpected
                happens that is to your advantage. A rope
                your opponent is hanging from might snap,
                the person you’re debating in front of an
                influential Aeon Priest might trip or forget
                what they were going to say, or something that
                was supposed to last only a round or two lasts
                a little while longer.
            </p>
