            <p>
                Glaives are the elite warriors of the Ninth World,
                using weapons and armor to fight their enemies.
                Hunters, guardians, and soldiers could be
                Glaives. Sometimes scouts, warlords, bandits,
                and even athletes are Glaives. “Glaive” is a
                common slang term used almost everywhere
                in the Steadfast and the Beyond for any person
                skilled with weapons or a martial art, but in truth,
                it applies only to the best of the best. Glaives
                are warriors who command abilities far beyond
                those of a typical person with a sword.
            </p>
            <p>
                Most Glaives are either strong (using the
                heaviest armor and weapons available and
                having a high Might) or fast (sticking
                with light weapons and armor and having
                a high Speed). A few attempt to use both
                Might and Speed and stay somewhere
                in the middle. Glaives also use ranged
                weapons such as bows or darts. Some
                don’t rely on weapons at all, preferring to
                use their bodies in hand-to-hand combat—
                punching, kicking, grabbing, throwing, and
                so on.
            </p>

            <p>
                <b>Glaives in Society:</b> In most cities and
                villages, people hold Glaives in great esteem.
                Although a Glaive could just as likely be a thug
                as a noble warrior, those who help protect their
                fellow humans from the dangers of the Ninth
                World are always treated with respect. There is
                no shame in getting paid for the use of one’s
                skills, so being a blade for hire is a perfectly
                acceptable profession. Restrictions on carrying
                weapons openly are rare, and most Glaives
                wear the tools of their trade with pride.
            </p>
            <p>
                Not surprisingly, Glaives often get along
                best with other Glaives, or at least soldiers,
                guards, or similar comrades in arms. Nanos,
                scholars, and people who aren’t terribly
                physical are less likely to mix well with Glaives,
                but obviously not every Glaive is the same.
                They focus on their bodies, but that doesn’t
                mean they don’t value more cerebral pursuits
                as well. A Glaive need not follow the stereotype
                of the dumb bruiser with a sword or an axe.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Glaives in the Group:</b> In a group of
                explorers, Glaives typically take the lead.
                They’re usually the most physically capable,
                the most durable, and the most ready to
                meet danger head-on. Sometimes they act
                protectively toward their companions; other
                times, they’re more self-interested.
                Either way, a Glaive’s place is
                often in the middle of the
                fray.
            </p>


            <p>
                <b>Glaives and the Numenera:</b> When it comes
                to the numenera, most Glaives are interested
                in weapons, armor, or devices that aid them
                in combat. The ancients produced all sorts
                of incredibly durable substances, many of
                which can be made into armor that is lighter
                and more protective than steel. Sometimes,
                Glaives can scavenge a suit of armor
                composed of these advanced materials, but
                more often they find the materials and then
                ask a crafter or smith to make the armor. Of
                course, the problem is that a substance that is
                difficult to damage is also hard to work.
            </p>
            <p>
                As varied as armoring materials might be,
                numenera weaponry is infinitely more so.
                These items include melee weapons that
                shock, stun, or burn whatever they touch;
                and ranged weapons that blast projectiles
                with incredible power or bursts of strange
                energies. There are also bombs, damaging
                energy fields, poisonous gases, and far
                stranger weaponry, but some Glaives find
                that such complex objects are better off in
                the hands of a Nano. Maneuverability is just
                as important as attack or defense, however,
                so an item that allows a Glaive to move
                quickly or negate gravity is a great prize.
            </p>
            <p>
                As for cyphers, Glaives prefer physically
                enhancing or restorative objects, such as
                injections of chemicals that improve reaction
                time or pills with microscopic repair devices
                that heal wounds and restore fatigued muscle
                tissue. They use the nickname “boost” for any
                cypher that enhances their strength, stamina,
                reflexes, or other physical aspects, while one
                that repairs damage or alleviates fatigue is
                called a “treat.”
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Advanced Glaives:</b> As they progress, Glaives
                become better combatants, often felling multiple
                foes in a single stroke. They gain special types
                of attacks and learn to use armor more efficiently
                to get the most out of the protection it offers.
            </p>

            <h3>GLAIVE BACKGROUND</h3>
            <p>
                Glaives are no mere bandits or town guards.
                They stand head and shoulders above ordinary
                soldiers and brawlers. Something in your
                background—whether intensive training,
                inborn traits, or biomechanical modification—
                has made you more than the others around
                you. Choose one of those three options
                (described below) as the source of your
                skills, strength, reflexes, and stamina. It will
                provide the foundation of your background
                and give you an idea of how you can improve.
                The GM can use this information to develop
                adventures and quests that are specific to your
                character and play a role in your advancement.
            </p>

            <b>INTENSIVE TRAINING</b>
            <p>
                You are strong, fast, or both, but what really
                separates you from the crowd is your training.
                Perhaps you ascended the highest peak of the
                Black Riage or sought the deepest sewers beneath
                Qi to find teachers who could show you how to
                move, fight, and endure beyond normal human
                limits. You know a thousand ways to kill a foe,
                most of them secret to all but a chosen few. You’re
                privy to techniques and fighting styles that most
                people in the Ninth World have never seen. You
                have learned that the impossible is possible—
                as long as you know the secret. Your body is a
                weapon, and your weapon is part of your body.
                You have studied with the masters, and now you
                carry that regimen as you venture into the world.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Advancement:</b> You need to train and practice
                constantly to hone your skills and develop new
                techniques, building on what you’ve been taught.
                Perhaps at some point you will return to your secret
                masters for further initiation or find new teachers
                or lessons that can take you to the next step.
                When you gain additional points for your
                stat Pools, an increase to a stat’s Edge, or an
                increase in the level of Effort you can apply, the
                benefit comes as the result of rigorous exercise
                and personal development. When you gain a
                new skill or Glaive ability, it’s the result of the
                martial arts you have studied.
            </p>

            <b>INBORN TRAITS</b>
            <p>
                You’ve trained under excellent instructors and
                have experience in many dangerous situations,
                but what makes you different is deep inside,
                entwined in your genetic heritage. Maybe it
                was the luck of being born fit. Maybe you’re
                a hulking brute—a mountainous figure who
                commands attention when you enter a room.
                Or maybe your strength is more subtle; you
                might be the descendant of a bioengineered
                species bred (or designed) for perfection.
                Perhaps you’re a mutant with psychic abilities
                that augment your physical nature; you guide
                and enhance your attacks with telekinesis,
                or you use a natural mutation in your brain
                to control matter on a molecular level to
                resist blows and inflict harm. Perhaps you’re
                something wholly new: an aberration or a
                human so perfect that you’re beyond human.
                You might be a posthuman—the next step
                toward the true destiny of the people of the
                Ninth World.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Advancement:</b> You have talents of which you
                are only dimly aware. You must practice and
                experiment to find your limitations, if any. At
                some point in the future, you might have to
                seek out someone who can help you master
                your inherent abilities. You were born with great
                power. Now you need to learn how to use that
                power, even if the education takes a lifetime.
                When your stats improve, it’s because you’re
                tapping deeper into the unknown reserves
                within you. When you gain a new Glaive ability,
                it’s the result of your superhuman traits as much
                as it is about your study, practice, or knowledge.
                You can do things that other people simply
                cannot, no matter how hard they train.
            </p>

            <b>BIOMECHANICAL MODIFICATION</b>
            <p>
                You might be a fighter, but you’re no archaic
                stereotype—this is the Ninth World, after all.
                Although you trained and gained your share of
                practical experience, you have the numenera
                on your side as well. Some of your knowledge
                of fighting techniques is implanted in your
                brain and spine, wired into your nerves and
                muscles. Your joints have surgically implanted
                servo motors. Subdermal plating makes you
                tougher than should be possible. Your muscle
                tissue is augmented with artificial fibers.
                Perhaps your genetic code has been rewritten
                by engineered viruses, or the tissues in your body
                have been reworked by nanotech, turning you
                into an efficient battle machine. Or maybe you’ve
                been altered by strange science—radioactive
                treatments of bizarre energies, chemical
                compounds and drugs, or extradimensional
                enhancements—that makes you stronger,
                faster, tougher, and more proficient in attack
                and defense than anyone around you.
                Whatever the case, you’re the result of
                ancient knowledge made manifest in the
                present, and now you’re shaping the future.
                Perhaps your modifications are obvious and
                visible; perhaps they’re not. Regardless, you
                know that you’re more than merely human.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Advancement:</b> Your body is an ongoing
                project. In a way, it’s a work of art, although
                its beauty comes not from its appearance but
                from what it can do. As you go forward, you
                should keep an eye out at all times for new parts
                and systems that can be incorporated into your
                body, or new doses of drugs and supplements to
                maintain your abilities. You might need to seek
                out surgeons, mechanics, or bioenhancement
                specialists to take you to the next level. Perhaps
                the Aeon Priests can help. Perhaps the parts you
                need can be found only in the ruins of the past or
                the dangerous black market of a faraway city.
                When your stats improve, it’s because you
                literally have added something new to your
                body. When you gain a new ability, it’s the
                direct result of a tangible change in your own
                physical being.
            </p>

            <h3>GLAIVE PLAYER INTRUSIONS</h3>
            <p>
                As a Glaive, you can spend 1XP to use one of
                the following player intrusions, provided the
                situation is appropriate and the GM agrees.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Perfect Setup:</b> You’re fighting at least three
                foes and each one is standing in exactly the
                right spot for you to use a move you trained
                in long ago, allowing you to attack all three as
                a single action. Make a separate attack roll for
                each foe. You remain limited by the amount of
                Effort you can apply on one action.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Old Friend:</b> A comrade in arms from your
                past shows up unexpectedly and provides
                aid in whatever you’re doing. They are on a
                mission of their own and can’t stay longer
                than it takes to help out, chat a while after, and
                perhaps share a quick meal.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Weapon Break:</b> Your foe’s weapon has a
                weak spot and in the course of the combat
                quickly becomes damaged and moves two
                steps down the object damage track.
            </p>
