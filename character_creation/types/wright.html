            <p>
                Wrights are builders and crafters. When
                something special is required, a Wright can
                make it. When strange instructions are found
                in the ruins of the prior worlds, Wrights can
                decipher them and, using special components
                called iotum, craft their own cyphers, artifacts,
                or installations. In a way, Wrights are especially
                good at understanding and stealing the fire
                of creation that burned so brightly in the
                civilizations that rose to unimaginable heights
                before the Ninth World. Wrights are the rarest
                of the already rare numenera scholars; they
                aren’t afraid of weird or incomprehensible
                tech—they try to take it apart and learn how to
                make more.
            </p>
            <p>
                Wrights are especially skilled in the many
                tasks related to crafting. They need to be at
                least a little skilled at a lot of things. They want
                Intellect to help them decipher and develop
                numenera plans, identify components, and
                craft amazing items.
            </p>
            <p>
                Wrights are not afraid to explore, especially
                because the iotum they need to make their
                wondrous items can usually be found only by
                salvaging it from places where physical danger
                is certain. They’re happy to don heavy armor to
                protect themselves from danger, even though
                it slows them down a little. Though such
                armor can be restrictive, Wrights can usually
                rely on allies or followers to help them search
                out a particularly difficult-to-reach or tight
                spot.
            </p>

            <p>
                <b>Wrights in Society:</b> People are usually
                very accepting of Wrights since the things
                they craft are often useful or
                even necessary, whether that
                means a wagon, a wall, or an
                installation that can light up a
                small community. When Wrights
                begin to dabble in more exotic
                installations, automatons, or
                vehicles, public concern can creep
                in. A Wright with an automaton
                servant might be seen by some as
                a sorcerer who has infused a demonic
                spirit into crude matter, giving it life like
                the automatons that litter the landscape
                and that most people have enough sense
                to avoid.
            </p>
            <p>
                But a Wright can be a vital part of any
                community, especially one that has special
                needs that can’t be met any other way. With
                enough time and resources, a Wright can
                provide clean water, nutrition, defense, and of
                course, comfortable homes for people to live
                in.
            </p>
            <p>
                Wrights get along well with Glaives
                and Delves. They rely on the former
                to protect them while they focus on
                creative tasks, and they trust that Delves
                will find and return fresh plan seeds and
                iotum that Wrights need to conduct their
                basic craft. Nanos can be friendly, but Wrights
                sometimes find themselves in competition
                with Nanos who want the same iotum,
                possibly for their own inscrutable tasks or
                even as an ingredient for their own crafting.
            </p>
            <p>
                Arkai often come to Wrights asking for
                the creation of particular structures or
                installations. As long as they’re asking and not
                ordering, the alliance remains on good terms.
                Wrights are friendly with some Jacks and sour
                on others; it depends on the Jack in question.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Wrights in the Group:</b> While an Arkus might
                naturally assume some authority in a newly
                founded settlement or allied community,
                Wrights can also fulfill that role because they
                tend to remain in such locations for extended
                periods of time. On the other hand, a Wright
                is usually happy to let others make the hard
                decisions so they can focus on making
                interesting things. In a straight-up fight,
                Wrights rely on their creations to aid both
                themselves and their allies; an established
                Wright might even have created defensive or
                offensive installations in the group’s base or
                newly founded settlement.
            </p>
            <p>
                Wrights and the Numenera: Wrights
                wouldn’t exist without the numenera. To craft
                anything other than mundane objects and
                structures, Wrights depend on iotum salvaged
                from scrap found in ruins and other locations,
                as well as fragments of information encoded
                in knowledge caches for millions of years or
                longer. So like Delves and Nanos, Wrights
                value any and all devices and discoveries
                related to the numenera and crave more.
            </p>
            <p>
                Wrights usually craft items that help a larger
                community, but they can also craft objects
                to aid themselves, if they can find the plans
                to do so. Artifacts and cyphers that provide
                protection, store knowledge, and extend their
                crafting capabilities further are the kinds of
                numenera items Wrights are most excited to
                find or fashion.
            </p>

            <p>
                <b>Advanced Wrights:</b> As Wrights gain experience
                and become more skilled and powerful, they
                develop more plans for building numenera
                objects and structures, they can drastically
                reduce the amount of time required to craft
                complex objects or structures, and they can take
                direct control of objects and structures they’ve
                built to create amazing effects.
            </p>

            <h3>WRIGHT BACKGROUND</h3>
            <p>
                Not everyone that crafts numenera items
                is a Wright—Wrights are simply those
                who’ve trained (or otherwise gained) unique
                abilities related to building wondrous things.
                Something in your background has put
                you in this position and is at least partially
                responsible for your talents. Choose one of the
                three options described below as the source
                of your skills, knowledge, and intuitions for
                craft, or create your own. It will provide the
                foundation of your background and give you
                an idea of how you can improve. The GM can
                use this information to develop adventures
                and quests that are specific to your character
                and play a role in your advancement.
            </p>

            <b>UNUSUAL UPBRINGING</b>
            <p>
                From a very early age, you had access to
                machines and tools, and you were encouraged
                to learn how to use them. Perhaps you were
                raised by a Nano or an Aeon Priest who thought
                building was more important than playing.
                Maybe your parents were obsessed with the
                numenera. Or perchance you were incubated
                and trained by machines who needed human
                ingenuity and creativity to solve a problem
                they couldn’t overcome. You stacked gears and
                circuits instead of wooden blocks, and your
                earliest drawings were schematics for toys you
                wanted to build. Your bedtime stories were
                about automatons, nanites, and electronics,
                and your dreams were filled with the wondrous
                things you would create with an endless supply
                of iotum and parts.
            </p>

            <p>
                When you grew older and prepared to set out
                on your own, you asked those who raised you
                what great work you could build for them as
                thanks for what they taught you—something
                contributing to their research, a device to
                overcome an infirmity, or even a new self-willed
                automaton to join them. Now you search for a
                suitable plan, the iotum to craft it, or both.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Advancement:</b> You’re always looking for
                new plans and, to the extent you can do so,
                researching new ones on your own. You have
                to push yourself, because researching new
                plans doesn’t come easy. You’re not even sure
                a limited mind like yours can do so without
                hurting itself. But you press on anyway, hoping
                for a breakthrough. Eventually, you hope to
                find a plan that will allow you to bring into this
                world something truly amazing so you can
                honor your caregivers and prove that you were
                worthy of their work and attention.
            </p>
            <b>UNEXPECTED BRILLIANCE</b>
            <p>
                Your mind developed early, way before your
                peers. Your parents realized it and delighted in
                challenging you with puzzles and projects. You
                could fix household items, and eventually you
                found your true passion: taking apart oddities,
                scrap, and depleted cyphers. You figured out
                how to make broken machines work again, and
                honed your ability to recognize what a jumble
                of parts could do if you put them together
                in just the right configuration. Most people
                respected and appreciated your talent, some
                tried to exploit you, and a few feared you, but
                your incredible mind made sure you always
                came out ahead—or gave you enough of a
                head start to get away from serious trouble.
            </p>
            <p>
                Whence did your brilliance spring? Just an
                accident of nurture and nature? Did you have
                a great-grandparent who was equally skilled?
                Or is your facility with objects and structures
                something inherent in you, such as a mutation
                in your brain that gives you insights that others
                can’t imagine? It’s a mystery, and one you’d like
                to solve one day. But only after you finish your
                current list of crafting projects.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Advancement:</b> Even your amazing talents
                have their limits. Even when you have the
                perfect plan for creating an amazing new
                installation, you’ve had setbacks and failures.
                This means you’re always looking for others
                like you, people with whom you can share
                your knowledge and they with you, so that
                perhaps together you’ll all progress to new
                heights. That’s not always possible, so usually
                your stats improve and you gain new abilities
                because you’ve taken the gifts you were born
                with and pushed them to the next level.
            </p>

            <b>MECHANICAL INDOCTRINATION</b>
            <p>
                The Prophecy was clear. If the machine that
                squatted at the center of town could not be
                awoken by midnight during the next eclipse,
                the Spear of God would strike like a burning
                sword from the void and blast everyone and
                everything to drit. You were one of the ones
                selected to awaken the Red Cube. You were
                schooled, drilled, and cypher-fed all manner
                of information, plans, knowledge, and even
                some physical know-how dripped into your
                blood by strange machines the city elders
                kept in dark basements. Others who were
                selected weakened and eventually died under
                the brutal regime of learning. It was rough
                on you, too, but where so many others failed,
                you succeeded. You learned. And with that
                knowledge, you repaired the machine and
                saved the city. But in the aftermath, you were
                different, both physically and psychologically.
            </p>

            <p>
                You weren’t taught how to craft things—
                it was programmed into you, hard-coded
                into your flesh and mind with drugs and
                technology, conditioned into your psyche
                with repetitive drills. You don’t know if
                the motivations of your captors/doctors/
                instructors were noble or nefarious, but the
                end result is that building things is as natural
                for you as breathing. You can assemble basic
                components when you’re half asleep just by
                using muscle memory. You may even have
                subdermal implants that convert nutrition and
                bodily wastes into components you need. You
                might feel like you were robbed of a normal
                childhood, or you might celebrate your strange
                education and embrace opportunities to learn
                and experience childish things with adult
                senses and intellect. In some ways, you are
                an organic machine built to create and repair
                other machines, but your skills are what allow
                you to survive and thrive in the Ninth World.
                Your goal may be to destroy those who created
                you, better understand their motives, or push
                forward their agenda.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Advancement:</b> You’re not sure if you
                learned because of, or despite, the many
                odd substances and cyphers used to make
                you what you are now, so you continue to try
                both. Learning and, whenever possible, using
                machines that promise to unlock new avenues
                of thought and creativity within you. You’re
                constantly on the lookout for new injections,
                energies, concoctions, and devices to improve
                your abilities and stats.
            </p>

            <h3>WRIGHT PLAYER INTRUSIONS</h3>
            <p>
                As a Wright, you can spend 1 XP to use one of
                the following player intrusions, provided the
                situation is appropriate and the GM agrees.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Device Perfection:</b> A device or installation
                works even better than you expected it would,
                at least in this instance. Maybe the range is
                twice as long, the duration is 100% longer, or
                the effect itself is 50% stronger.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Crafting Insight:</b> You are inspired, and you
                finish crafting the object or structure earlier
                than was expected (maybe even halving the
                total time).
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Tinkering Vision:</b> When using your Always
                Tinkering special ability, you discover that the
                materials you’re using are of unexpectedly high
                quality, giving you specific options to choose
                from. So instead of gaining a random cypher,
                you gain the cypher of your choice (though it’s
                still a temperamental cypher, so it’s 2 levels
                lower than normal and you can’t give it to
                someone else without destroying it).
