            <p>
                Nanos are sometimes called mages, wizards,
                sorcerers, or witches by the people of the
                Ninth World. Nano-sorcerer is also a common
                term, with their abilities referred to as nanosorcery. Some claim to be the representatives
                of gods or other supernatural agencies.
                Whatever they’re called, Nanos master the
                mysteries of the past to the degree that they
                seem to perform miracles. They tap into the
                numenera to alter reality or learn things that
                they couldn’t otherwise know.
            </p>
            <p>
                The term “Nano” is derived from the
                nanotechnology that is omnipresent throughout
                the Ninth World (whether anyone realizes it or
                not). Sometimes people call these invisible,
                numinous particles that infuse the landscape
                nano-spirits. Sometimes these spirits take on a
                devastating manifestation called the iron wind
                and move through the air in clouds, which can
                be far more dangerous than any conventional
                storm. In truth, nanites are literally everywhere.
            </p>

            <p>
                Nanos wield their power in the form of what
                they call esoteries, although some prefer to call
                them spells, enchantments, or charms. Nanos
                are proficient with other devices as well, and
                sometimes their powers are actually the subtle
                use of such items hidden upon their person.
                All Nanos call forth their power in slightly
                different ways.
            </p>
            <p>
                Typically, Nanos are intelligent, learned,
                and insightful. Most of the time, they devote
                themselves to the numenera and other
                esoterica rather than to purely physical pursuits.
                As a result, they’re often well versed in the
                artifacts and leftovers of the previous worlds.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Nanos in Society:</b> Frequently, common
                folks fear Nanos or look upon them with
                suspicion. It’s easy to be afraid of a brute with
                an axe, but when it comes to someone who
                wields invisible powers—magic, for lack of a
                better term—too much is unknown. A Nano’s
                strange abilities are unsettling even to the
                bravest souls unless they have a modicum of
                knowledge about the numenera. That said,
                not everyone is frightened of or intimidated
                by Nanos. There are other people and
                creatures that have capabilities far beyond the
                understanding of normal folks—things that
                even Nanos might not understand. Things that
                even Nanos might fear.
            </p>
            <p>
                Like the wizards of fables, some Nanos
                dwell in solitude to study and conduct odd
                experiments, while others gather in schools and
                teach those with potential to use their abilities.
                They enjoy time in the company of people with
                similar predilections and interests. Not every
                Nano is a frail bookworm, however—that’s just
                the stereotype placed upon them by society.
                Sometimes, people view Nanos as
                representatives of the powers that be: gods,
                demons, or spirits. That’s not too surprising
                considering that they affect the world around
                them in ways that most people can’t fathom.
                What’s more surprising is that some Nanos
                believe this to be true as well. They call
                themselves priests or shamans and treat
                their esoteries more like rituals, prayers, or
                invocations. When these Nanos gather, they
                do so in temples, but just as often one of them
                lives alone amid a flock of the faithful. Some
                of these loner Nanos don’t call themselves
                priests; they call themselves gods.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Nanos in the Group:</b> Typically, a Nano is
                the party member who keeps to the back of
                the group, as far from the danger as possible.
                Compared to their comrades, Nanos are often
                a bit fragile and less well protected against
                threats. In addition, most of their abilities work
                best at range.
            </p>

            <p>
                As useful and impressive as Nanos’ offensive
                powers can be, their knowledge is often most
                valuable to a group. When the party comes
                upon mysterious devices, weird creatures, or
                other aspects of the numenera, the Nano is
                usually the one who knows how to identify or
                deal with the finds. They can scavenge for new
                cyphers or figure out how to use artifacts from
                the past. Many Nanos possess other valuable
                knowledge in areas such as geography, botany,
                medicine, and more.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Nanos and the Numenera:</b> All Nanos know a
                fair bit about the numenera. In many ways, it’s
                their lifeblood. When a group finds a broken
                vehicle, an inactive automaton, or an ancient
                machine, the Nano steps up and searches it
                for useful devices.
            </p>
            <p>
                Almost any numenera item would be
                welcome, but generally, Nanos are most
                interested in ranged weapons, protective
                devices other than armor, and devices that have
                interesting utility effects—using magnetism,
                creating force fields, healing wounds, reshaping
                flesh, creating or destroying matter, and so on.
                This is true of cyphers as well as artifacts.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Advanced Nanos:</b> As Nanos gain more
                experience, they typically learn new and more
                powerful esoteries. They begin their careers by
                making personal shields and blasting foes with
                energy, but eventually, they can fly through the
                air, disintegrate matter, teleport vast distances,
                and control the weather.
            </p>


            <h3>NANO BACKGROUND</h3>
            <p>
                Nanos can do things that seem like magic to
                other people, but their powers aren’t based
                on charms or spellcasting—the explanation
                is likely far stranger. Choose one of the three
                options described below as the source of your
                abilities. It will provide the foundation of your
                background and give you an idea of how you
                can improve. The GM can use this information
                to develop adventures and quests that are
                specific to your character and play a role in
                your advancement.
            </p>
            <b>FORBIDDEN KNOWLEDGE</b>
            <p>
                You understand the numenera far better than
                most people do. You know that it isn’t just
                strange machines buried in old ruins. The
                numenera is everywhere, beyond the perception
                of humans. You know that microscopic
                machines called nanites are threaded
                through every inch of the world, waiting to be
                activated. You know that satellites in orbit are
                broadcasting information, waiting for someone
                to access it. Having studied long and hard,
                learning the proper ways to tap into the forces
                all around you, you know how to activate these
                machines and make them do what you wish,
                at least in limited, specific ways. These uses of
                power are called esoteries.
            </p>
            <p>
                Through various tiny devices that you
                possess, which probably seem like magic
                charms to the uninitiated, you “conjure”
                energy. By accessing the datasphere
                transmitted across the world, you connect with
                machines—including the nanites—to change
                your environment.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Advancement:</b> You must continue to study.
                There’s far more to the numenera than one
                person can ever know, but that doesn’t mean
                you shouldn’t try to learn it all. More secrets
                and more knowledge mean more power. At
                some point in your career, you might need to
                find a teacher or another source of knowledge.
                So many questions need answers.
                When your stats improve or you learn new
                skills, it’s because you have mastered another
                new technique that taps into the secret world.
                When you gain a new esotery, it’s the result of
                long hours of study and practice in using your
                mysterious lore.
            </p>
            <b>PSIONICS</b>
            <p>
                You know that the world is filled with ancient
                machines and their creations. Some of them
                are visible, but many are not. It’s not just skill
                or knowledge that allows you to gain access
                to them. You have a psychic talent to interface
                with the machines to produce various effects.
                Some of these machines are secreted about
                your person, and others are infused into the
                environment of the Ninth World.
            </p>
            <p>
                You can’t conjure energy or warp matter on
                your own, but you have the rare and spectacular
                ability to control the invisible nano-machines
                that do it for you. Is this gift the natural result
                of extreme exposure to technology? Is it the
                fusion of the biological and the mechanical? Is
                it the design of a genius architect, generations
                earlier, who manipulated the genetics of your
                family? Or is it just a random mutation? In any
                case, you’re the natural synthesis of human and
                machine, working as one.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Advancement:</b> Understanding this natural
                talent took time and training, and more of
                both is needed to expand and refine your
                powers. In addition to seeking help with your
                instruction, you might need to find drugs,
                devices, or other external stimulation.
                When aspects of your character improve or
                you learn new skills or esoteries, it’s because
                you have mastered a new facet of your psychic
                abilities or discovered an entirely new use for a
                machine in your environment.
            </p>


            <b>PORTS AND PLUGS</b>
            <p>
                You have a connection with machines for
                one clear reason: you’re practically a machine
                yourself. Your nervous system is laced with
                circuitry, and your body has implanted jacks
                and ports where you plug in modules and other
                technological bits that provide your capabilities.
                When you produce effects or manipulate
                nanites, you do so through your body’s direct
                mechanical interface. Your force blasts might
                come from a device implanted in your palm or
                fingertip. Your ability to tap into the datasphere
                might come from the receiver plugged into a
                port you built in the back of your neck.
            </p>
            <p>
                Obviously, to become a Nano, you
                have undergone numerous surgeries and
                procedures (either willingly or unwillingly). You
                are forever changed. Some people treat you
                with disdain or derision, but perhaps most of
                your modifications can be hidden by a hooded
                cloak or similar garment.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Advancement:</b> Do you want to gain more
                abilities? Just find new hardware and plug it in.
                Although talent and practice are still involved,
                physical upgrades are your primary means
                of picking up new tricks. Adding points to
                your stat Pools might mean undergoing new
                procedures. Adding a new esotery might require
                putting an implant in your head, although
                changing one esotery to another could be as
                simple as unplugging one module and jacking
                in a replacement.
            </p>

            <h3>NANO PLAYER INTRUSIONS</h3>
            <p>
                When playing a Nano, you can spend 1 XP
                to use one of the following player intrusions,
                provided the situation is appropriate and the
                GM agrees.
            </p>

            <p>
                <b>Advantageous Malfunction:</b> A numenera
                device that is being used against you
                malfunctions. It might harm the user or one of
                their allies for a round, or activate a dramatic
                and distracting side effect for a few rounds.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Convenient Glimmer:</b> A glimmer provides
                you with a clear answer or suggests a course
                of action with regard to an urgent question,
                problem, or obstacle you’re facing.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Inexplicably Unbroken:</b> An inactive, ruined,
                or presumed-destroyed device temporarily
                activates and performs a useful function
                relevant to the situation. This is enough to buy
                you some time for a better solution, alleviate
                a complication that was interfering with your
                abilities, or just get you one more use out of a
                depleted cypher or artifact.
