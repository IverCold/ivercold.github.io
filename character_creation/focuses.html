                    <p>
                        Every movement is an expression of energy. You can harness this kinetic energy and transform it
                        into other kinds of energy. At first, once you absorb energy, you must use it before you can
                        absorb any more. You can use the absorbed energy as a weapon, or you can infuse an object with
                        dangerous energy that is released upon touch. Eventually, you will be able to use the energy for
                        nonviolent purposes, such as healing or invigorating creatures. Glaives often gain the biggest
                        benefit from being energy absorbers, as they are the ones most often being struck in combat, and
                        many of the initial uses of absorbed energy are for combat. However, Wrights can potentially use
                        some of that energy to improve their crafting abilities.

                    <p>
                        You’re a rebel. You resist the dictates of authority, you try to break away from the control
                        that society holds over you, and you like to flout traditions that you view as backward. That’s
                        not to say that you automatically disagree with anything or anyone you deal with. It’s more that
                        you believe certain institutions and conventions are foolish and even hurtful. This is why you
                        often press your luck and defy the status quo. Often enough, you get away with it.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In fact, your success is more than a mere twist of statistics. You enjoy some kind of psychic
                        enhancement, implanted device, or attention of a datasphere spirit. You’ve also practiced
                        certain skills, behaviors, and attitudes that allow blame to slip off you like water off a
                        murden. A character who acts without consequence often dresses in flamboyant garments designed
                        to draw the eye, as if they’re tempting the universe to notice them after all. Those who can
                        successfully act without consequence could walk into the center of a city square, steal a fruit
                        from a vendor, pass it to a beggar in full view of everyone, and suffer no repercussions
                        whatsoever. Glaives, Jacks, Delves, and Arkai are drawn to acting without consequence.

                <div class="column-text-left">
                    <p>
                        You have the power to command the Leviathan—your name for the horrific things that wait in the
                        empty ruins or hunt in the dark beyond the town walls, creatures with long teeth, hellish fury,
                        and a hunger for human flesh. The Leviathan is the spirit of the predatory, the monstrous, and
                        the sociopathic. Sometimes, you suspect the term applies to a specific variety of creature, all
                        descended from a literal entity called the Leviathan—a bloodline you perhaps share in some small
                        way, explaining why you can command and control these terrible creatures that preferentially
                        hunt humans over all other flesh.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Ninth Worlders are generally unaware of the Leviathan, but here and there, you run across
                        pockets of people who know of the horrors of which you speak. Some believe it is a spirit that
                        takes up residence in certain creatures, though others suggest the same as you believe - it is a
                        strain of life that corrupts and changes what it touches. Metaphorically, it’s easy to say that
                        all living, nonhuman predators are of the Leviathan. But you have a feeling, even if you’ve not
                        said it in so many words yet, that one day a creature you encounter will be the Leviathan.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Glaives, Jacks, and Delves are eager to command creatures that would otherwise try to eat them,
                        putting a leash on them.

                <h2 class="column-centered-header">AUGMENTS FLESH WITH GRAFTS</h2>
                <div class="column-text-left">
                    <p>
                        Machines can be upgraded and improved, and the human body is just an organic machine. Your goal
                        is to keep improving your physical form, replacing obsolete parts of your body with new grafts
                        and trying to become supremely efficient at your normal and augmented biological processes.
                        Whether you do this with technology or pieces from other creatures depends on what you find in
                        your explorations and your estimation of your flaws and shortcomings. You don’t believe it’s
                        possible to achieve perfection—perfection is an ongoing process, not a final state. If following
                        this path makes you something more than human, so be it. You left behind childish toys and forms
                        to become an adult, so you are willing to leave your humanity behind in order to become
                        something greater.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Glaives see grafting as a way to increase their physical power and survive attacks from
                        dangerous opponents. Delves often have many opportunities to find and use grafts, and Wrights
                        can use their own knowledge of the numenera to craft custom limbs and other body grafts for
                        themselves. Grafting flesh for cosmetic purposes doesn’t count as a grafted cypher. Many
                        characters with this focus graft parts from their enemies and show them off like trophies.
                        Grafters can experiment with adding grafts to other creatures, but the process is painful and
                        prone to failure. Amoral grafters usually keep multiple “volunteers" on hand for
                        experimentation.

                <div class="column-text-left">
                    <p>
                        Life is for the living—the biological. Automatons, animate machines, thinking machines, and
                        anything similar are abominations. You excel at battling these anathemas, cleansing the world of
                        their contaminating presence.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Maybe your desire to battle automatons comes from religious zealotry. Maybe it’s steeped in
                        revenge for some past crime committed by a machine. Maybe you don’t know why you’re driven to
                        destroy animate machines. Maybe you’re just good at it.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You probably bear the trophies of former “kills” on you, wearing bits of numenera on your belt
                        or
                        around your neck. You also likely use heavy weaponry, ideal for penetrating armor. Glaives are
                        most
                        often automaton fighters, particularly those who are quick and nimble, able to leap in, cutting
                        a
                        few vital wires here or slicing through a component panel there. Some creatures are a mixture of
                        machine and biological. Your GM decides whether such creatures can be treated as biological,
                        machine, or both in some cases.

                        You can create a sheath of flames around your body. You leave scorch marks wherever you go, and
                        you can’t handle combustible objects without first dousing your inherent flames. Your special
                        abilities (such as Nano esoteries) are tainted with flame. Fiery visuals accompany your powers,
                        and in some cases, your predilection for flame actually reshapes your abilities to take on a
                        fiery nature where none existed before. You probably wear red and yellow, or perhaps black.
                    </p>

                        Although most of those who take up this mantle are Nanos, flame-wielding Glaives and Jacks are

                <div class="column-text-left">
                    <p>
                        Anyone can use a shield. But few can project a protective force field that crackles with
                        otherworldly energy. Maybe your ability comes from a childhood encounter with a strange machine
                        or a metallic nodule that protrudes above your flesh along your spine, or perhaps it is
                        something that people in your family are capable of once every few generations. You use your
                        force field to not only protect yourself, but to aggressively bash those who would do you harm.
                        At first, you can create only a small protective plane. But as your skills improve, you can
                        learn to throw it at foes and have it rebound, heal allies, and release an explosion of
                        destructive energy each time it strikes home.

                    <p>
                        Glaives and Delves are most likely to choose this focus.

                    <p>
                        Through some modification of your body— mutation, mechanical enhancement, nanoreinforcement, or
                        something else—you have the ability to smash through walls, destroy weapons, shatter shackles,
                        break devices, and otherwise annihilate objects that would be difficult or even impossible for
                        others to demolish. You’re a breaker. You do not flinch; you punch right through that wall,
                        smash that machine, and fold the enemy’s metallic sword in half in an impressive and
                        intimidating display. Depending on the method that gives you this ability, your act might be
                        accompanied by flashes of energy, sound, or acidic odors. Once you display your impressive
                        skills as a destroyer, your enemies sometimes surrender rather than face an apparent force of
                        nature like yourself.

                        You likely wear armor, but probably not the heaviest armor you can because you don’t want

                        have looked like. Their inspiring heights, strange shapes, colors that human eyes can’t see,
                        connections between structures that allowed the unknowable peoples of those bygone eras to step
                        from one to the next... Well, you don’t know for certain what it must have been like, but you
                        gain just as much pleasure imagining the future you will build, using the seeds of ancient

                        You have always had special abilities that others didn’t seem to share. Through practice and
                        devotion, you have honed this unique talent so that you can harness the power of your mind to

                        to you by someone who recognized your ability, or you came upon it by accident and it triggered

                        it’s not uncommon for birds to alight on your shoulder or for small animals to climb up your
                        arms or legs.

                    <p>
                        You probably wear tough clothing and have a disheveled or grizzled appearance that suggests a
                        rugged, outdoor life. Perhaps you even smell like an animal.

                    <p>
                        Gravity must have been quite a concern for the people of prior epochs because there are many
                        paths within the numenera to control it. Through a quirk of fate, some unique device(s), or
                        supreme devotion (or a combination of all three), you have learned to tap into the power of
                        gravity. With one foot planted in the distant past, you are a mysterious individual. Most
                        likely, you are also older, having spent much of your life honing your odd, ancient talents.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You might prefer billowy garments that display your mastery of gravity’s pull and conceal your
                        identity and intentions.

                    <p>
                        No one type of character is more likely to control gravity than another, but the power is rare.

                        You use the numenera to create holographic images that appear real. You are, in effect, an
                        artist—a crafter of light and sound. Holographic images can never inflict direct harm or exert
                        real force, but they can fool creatures, changing opinions and even behaviors if you craft them
                        cleverly.

                    <p>
                        You likely dress with flair and color. The appearance of things is important to you, both their
                        beauty and their ugliness. You are a visual performer who can entertain, terrify, or fool
                        everyone you encounter.

                        A Nano is the most likely character to be an illusionist, but Jacks find illusions to be helpful

                        the light—something you dubbed dark matter. It responded to you, almost like a living thing.
                        When you made shadow puppets, they were dark matter condensed and became briefly real. As you
                        grew older, you learned to harness your gift for more than play. You can condense dark matter
                        from thin air, pulling it from the void spaces or a transdimensional pocket that few others can
                        access. You don’t fear dark matter, but others should when you’re around.

                        You are a defender. Places are special to you, and seeing them overrun hurts your soul to its
                        core. Perhaps you had a bad experience once, where a place that you loved was lost in war. After
                        that, you vowed - never again. You sought out special training, and more than that, a connection
                        to the nanites that some possess but most people think of as magic. This connection is conferred
                        via mutation, a special device, psychic concentration, or some other method that links you to
                        the numenera. Your connection grows over time, granting you the ability to defend a city, a
                        wall, or even just a single but all-important gate.

                    <p>
                        You probably wear obvious armor, perhaps even distinctive in its defensive nature. A few spikes
                        and scowling faces worked into the pattern might discourage those seeking to get past you.

                        Glaives are the obvious character to prefer this focus, though a Wright defending an

                        Someone has to stand up for the helpless, the weak, and the unprotected. You believe this duty
                        falls to you, and thus you have spent much of your life watching out for the people around you.
                        When you see them in trouble, you are the first to come to their aid. You might give up your
                        last shin to help the hungry, take a beating to save a person from the same, or rally your
                        friends to take on injustice wherever you find it.

                    <p>
                        You probably bear many scars from previous conflicts, but for each scar, you likely also have a
                        token of gratitude. You may have a dried flower given to you by a lady you saved from brigands,
                        or a bit of metal given to you by a starving man you fed.

                        Glaives typically take up the cause of the weak, having the grit, determination, and durability
                        to face down dangerous threats. Jacks, however, may pursue these goals as vigilantes, while
                        Nanos bring to bear fabulous powers in the defense of others. Delves are least likely to take up
                        this cause, as they tend to be loners. On the other hand, Wrights and Arkai, many of whom have
                        the good of others in mind at all times, are sometimes drawn to more direct methods of defending
                        others.

                        You descend from privilege, wealth, and power. Your family once owned land (perhaps they still
                        do), wielded political control, and accumulated vast wealth. You’ve stepped away from that
                        somewhat, though you still carry a noble title, whether you want it or not. People sometimes
                        recognize your name, and sometimes they recognize you as being descended from nobility. But with
                        many areas being so isolated from each other, people in an area far from where you came from may
                        never even have heard of the place where your family is known.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Since you were raised a certain way, you probably dress smartly and carry yourself in such a way
                        that inspires, endears, or intimidates. You have a voice suited to drawing attention (unless you
                        choose to disguise it).

                    <p>
                        Descends From Nobility pairs well with a type such as Glaive or Nano because it provides an
                        additional dimension of history to a character who can otherwise become single-minded in their
                        focus to increase their knowledge of fighting or the numenera, respectively.

                    <p>
                        There is a gap in your memory lasting well over a year. One moment, you were marveling at the
                        appearance of a floating obelisk. The next, you were waking up in a shallow crater, being helped
                        up by a traveler. They witnessed you emerging from the side of that same obelisk, then falling
                        and smiting the ground. Instead of dying, you made a crater, because your body was somehow
                        changed and had become crystalline.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You’ve tried to return to the obelisk in an attempt to determine what happened to you, but
                        failed. Eventually, you hope to return. Until then, you explore, hoping to learn more about the
                        numenera in general and master more of your own crystalline nature in particular.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Any character type can have emerged from an obelisk, though the crystalline body they enjoy is
                        most likely to be appreciated by Glaives and Delves. Weird creatures are something that
                        explorers might expect to see on a regular basis, and someone who has emerged from an obelisk
                        qualifies. However, residents in small communities and others who do not travel often will
                        likely be highly suspicious and perhaps even afraid of such a character, at least initially.

                        NONHUMANOID CRYSTALLINE FORM If your character who Emerges From the Obelisk is significantly
                        different from a regular human shape—such as if you choose to be a levitating crystal
                        shard—you’ll
                        have to work with your GM to come up with an alternative method for manipulating objects like a
                        regular human could, whether that’s short-range telekinesis or crystalline tendrils.

                        You are an entertainer - a singer, dancer, poet, storyteller, or something similar. You perform
                        for the benefit of others. Naturally charismatic and talented, you have also studied to master
                        your art. You know all the old poems, songs, jokes, and stories, and you’re skilled at creating
                        new ones, too.

                    <p>
                        You probably wear flamboyant or at least fashionable clothes and use cosmetics, tattoos, or hair

                        giving you a ghostly translucence.

                    <p>
                        With concentration, you can pass your hand through a solid object, allow a solid object to pass
                        harmlessly through you, or literally walk through walls. However, moving in and out of different
                        phase states requires extreme force of will and can be mentally taxing. The explanation for your
                        strange power lies within some aspect of the numenera. Perhaps the ability emerged through the
                        use of (or exposure to) lingering transdimensional technology or as the result of an encounter
                        with a creature not native to this world or dimension. Perhaps one of your ancestors first
                        developed the power and passed it down through generations.

                    <p>
                        You might do whatever you can to play up your translucent appearance by wearing diaphanous,
                        billowy clothing, or, depending on your personality, you might do just the opposite.

                        defensive capabilities. Glaives can use the offensive and defensive aspects but might find them

                        bit hindering as well.

                        You explore the foreboding ruins and mysterious locales of the ancient eras, trained in such
                        activities by those who have gone before you. You’re the archetypical treasure hunter,
                        scavenger, and finder of lost things. You spend so much of your time in the dark that you slowly
                        adapt to it, almost becoming a creature of the gloom yourself. Even in civilized areas, you
                        prefer to keep to the shadows.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Most likely, you wear dark clothing to help you blend into the blackness. On the other hand, you
                        might wear sensible garments and gear because you have serious and dangerous business to attend
                        to in the dark.

                    <p>
                        Jacks are suited to exploring dark places; those who do so are called shadowjacks. Glaives who
                        follow this path are known as shadow warriors, and Nanos are called shadowcasters.

                        What things were like long ago fires your imagination. You are equally thrilled to learn about
                        how a dead civilization lived as you are to regain a still-functioning oddity, cypher, or iotum
                        that the dead civilization used. For you, knowledge is an end in itself, but that doesn’t make
                        you naive to the dangers exploration poses. The opposite is true, which is why you’re no slouch
                        when it comes to defending yourself. You’re a born excavator and explorer, adept at moving and
                        maneuvering, making discoveries, and resisting the dangers that forgotten places often hold.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You probably wear sensible garments that can stand up to both rain and sun, as well as a hat or
                        head wrapping to keep off the sun and extra water for when the trail peters out in the middle of
                        nowhere.

                        You were once part of a much larger martial society, where you held a position of elevated
                        respect. The society might have been a tribe of abhumans, a military unit, a secret group of
                        warriors that live in a limited dimension, or something else. Whatever the specifics (which you
                        and your GM should work together to decide), you formed close personal ties with them and
                        trained to fight in small and large groups alike. But at some point, you left, perhaps to seek
                        your destiny, because you were exiled, or because everyone in the society spends a significant
                        time away before returning to retire. Though you are gone, the lessons of teamwork and
                        leadership that you learned while part of that society remain with you.

                    <p>
                        Whatever you wear, it likely includes the symbol, insignia, or some other reminder of the group
                        you left behind.

                        You know that style is at least as important as substance. Defeating foes is secondary to
                        looking good while doing it. Some might call you a swashbuckler or daredevil. You leap through
                        the air, make a flourish with your weapon, and attack, usually with a clever, biting show of
                        wit. Your enemies hate you, but your allies adore you. Just watching you fight is entertaining.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You very likely wear no armor, instead preferring stylish clothing—perhaps even a hat with a
                        feather.

                    <p>
                        Jacks and Glaives make the best swashbucklers, and they are the most common types of characters
                        to fight with panache.

                        Telekinesis. Psychokinesis. Mind over matter. The power has many names, but in the end, it all
                        boils down to one thing—the molecules that make up all matter are yours to command. You likely
                        call yourself a telekinetic or just a TK.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Many telekinetics prefer to wear tight clothing without much accoutrement, so there is little
                        that another TK could grab hold of psychically. On the other hand, you have the power to create
                        very minor telekinetic effects at will, so your hair might always be in motion, you could have a
                        few tiny objects floating around you, or you might wear a long cape that’s always billowing.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Jacks are the most likely characters to be telekinetics, but Glaives find that the abilities add
                        to their combat prowess, and Nanos, of course, appreciate the additional power.

                        At some point in your past, some of your
                        organic parts were replaced with artificial
                        components. (Alternatively, you belong to
                        a secret species of biomechanical hybrids.)
                        These artificial components might be
                        subdermal, or they might resemble more overt
                        metal or synth plating on your skin. They can
                        also take the form of threadlike tendrils of
                        circuitry winding across your flesh. Whatever
                        their appearance, these components give you
                        special abilities. As you advance, you can add
                        to, modify, or discover new functions for them.
                        Unfortunately, your artificial body also has
                        special requirements when it takes damage.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You might wear a cloak with a hood or
                        something similar to hide your artificial parts
                        from those who would persecute you. Because
                        your components are tricky to repair, as time
                        goes on, it might become more difficult
                        to conceal your true nature, with exposed
                        circuitry, metal plates, and more in a state of
                        partial disassembly.

                    Sometimes the numenera is a double-edged
                    sword. You are cursed and blessed to be able
                    to transform into a powerful creature, drawing
                    additional mass from a transdimensional source.
                    You and the GM should work out the exact
                    nature of the creature, including its appearance,
                    but it’s a wild beast of rage and blood—at least
                    until you learn to control it. Creatures like you
                    are often called “lycanthropes.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    Style and appearance are probably low on
                    your list of concerns. Your clothes might be
                    ragged because your transformation is hard on
                    them (or they’re cheap because you know they’ll
                    be destroyed the next time you transform).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Anyone can be a lycanthrope. A Glaive likely
                    benefits the most from the transformation.
