                    <p>
                        Every movement is an expression of energy. You can harness this kinetic energy and transform it
                        into other kinds of energy. At first, once you absorb energy, you must use it before you can
                        absorb any more. You can use the absorbed energy as a weapon, or you can infuse an object with
                        dangerous energy that is released upon touch. Eventually, you will be able to use the energy for
                        nonviolent purposes, such as healing or invigorating creatures. Glaives often gain the biggest
                        benefit from being energy absorbers, as they are the ones most often being struck in combat, and
                        many of the initial uses of absorbed energy are for combat. However, Wrights can potentially use
                        some of that energy to improve their crafting abilities.

                    <p>
                        You’re a rebel. You resist the dictates of authority, you try to break away from the control
                        that society holds over you, and you like to flout traditions that you view as backward. That’s
                        not to say that you automatically disagree with anything or anyone you deal with. It’s more that
                        you believe certain institutions and conventions are foolish and even hurtful. This is why you
                        often press your luck and defy the status quo. Often enough, you get away with it.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In fact, your success is more than a mere twist of statistics. You enjoy some kind of psychic
                        enhancement, implanted device, or attention of a datasphere spirit. You’ve also practiced
                        certain skills, behaviors, and attitudes that allow blame to slip off you like water off a
                        murden. A character who acts without consequence often dresses in flamboyant garments designed
                        to draw the eye, as if they’re tempting the universe to notice them after all. Those who can
                        successfully act without consequence could walk into the center of a city square, steal a fruit
                        from a vendor, pass it to a beggar in full view of everyone, and suffer no repercussions
                        whatsoever. Glaives, Jacks, Delves, and Arkai are drawn to acting without consequence.

                <div class="column-text-wide">
                    <p>
                        You have the power to command the Leviathan—your name for the horrific things that wait in the
                        empty ruins or hunt in the dark beyond the town walls, creatures with long teeth, hellish fury,
                        and a hunger for human flesh. The Leviathan is the spirit of the predatory, the monstrous, and
                        the sociopathic. Sometimes, you suspect the term applies to a specific variety of creature, all
                        descended from a literal entity called the Leviathan—a bloodline you perhaps share in some small
                        way, explaining why you can command and control these terrible creatures that preferentially
                        hunt humans over all other flesh.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Ninth Worlders are generally unaware of the Leviathan, but here and there, you run across
                        pockets of people who know of the horrors of which you speak. Some believe it is a spirit that
                        takes up residence in certain creatures, though others suggest the same as you believe - it is a
                        strain of life that corrupts and changes what it touches. Metaphorically, it’s easy to say that
                        all living, nonhuman predators are of the Leviathan. But you have a feeling, even if you’ve not
                        said it in so many words yet, that one day a creature you encounter will be the Leviathan.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Glaives, Jacks, and Delves are eager to command creatures that would otherwise try to eat them,
                        putting a leash on them.

                <h2 class="column-centered-header">AUGMENTS FLESH WITH GRAFTS</h2>
                <div class="column-text-left">
                    <p>
                        Machines can be upgraded and improved, and the human body is just an organic machine. Your goal
                        is to keep improving your physical form, replacing obsolete parts of your body with new grafts
                        and trying to become supremely efficient at your normal and augmented biological processes.
                        Whether you do this with technology or pieces from other creatures depends on what you find in
                        your explorations and your estimation of your flaws and shortcomings. You don’t believe it’s
                        possible to achieve perfection—perfection is an ongoing process, not a final state. If following
                        this path makes you something more than human, so be it. You left behind childish toys and forms
                        to become an adult, so you are willing to leave your humanity behind in order to become
                        something greater.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Glaives see grafting as a way to increase their physical power and survive attacks from
                        dangerous opponents. Delves often have many opportunities to find and use grafts, and Wrights
                        can use their own knowledge of the numenera to craft custom limbs and other body grafts for
                        themselves. Grafting flesh for cosmetic purposes doesn’t count as a grafted cypher. Many
                        characters with this focus graft parts from their enemies and show them off like trophies.
                        Grafters can experiment with adding grafts to other creatures, but the process is painful and
                        prone to failure. Amoral grafters usually keep multiple “volunteers" on hand for
                        experimentation.

                    <p>
                        Life is for the living—the biological. Automatons, animate machines, thinking machines, and
                        anything similar are abominations. You excel at battling these anathemas, cleansing the world of
                        their contaminating presence.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Maybe your desire to battle automatons comes from religious zealotry. Maybe it’s steeped in
                        revenge for some past crime committed by a machine. Maybe you don’t know why you’re driven to
                        destroy animate machines. Maybe you’re just good at it.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You probably bear the trophies of former “kills” on you, wearing bits of numenera on your belt
                        or
                        around your neck. You also likely use heavy weaponry, ideal for penetrating armor. Glaives are
                        most
                        often automaton fighters, particularly those who are quick and nimble, able to leap in, cutting
                        a
                        few vital wires here or slicing through a component panel there. Some creatures are a mixture of
                        machine and biological. Your GM decides whether such creatures can be treated as biological,
                        machine, or both in some cases.

                        You can create a sheath of flames around your body. You leave scorch marks wherever you go, and
                        you can’t handle combustible objects without first dousing your inherent flames. Your special
                        abilities (such as Nano esoteries) are tainted with flame. Fiery visuals accompany your powers,
                        and in some cases, your predilection for flame actually reshapes your abilities to take on a
                        fiery nature where none existed before. You probably wear red and yellow, or perhaps black.

                <div class="column-text-left">
                    <p>
                        Anyone can use a shield. But few can project a protective force field that crackles with
                        otherworldly energy. Maybe your ability comes from a childhood encounter with a strange machine
                        or a metallic nodule that protrudes above your flesh along your spine, or perhaps it is
                        something that people in your family are capable of once every few generations. You use your
                        force field to not only protect yourself, but to aggressively bash those who would do you harm.
                        At first, you can create only a small protective plane. But as your skills improve, you can
                        learn to throw it at foes and have it rebound, heal allies, and release an explosion of
                        destructive energy each time it strikes home.

                        Through some modification of your body— mutation, mechanical enhancement, nanoreinforcement, or
                        something else—you have the ability to smash through walls, destroy weapons, shatter shackles,
                        break devices, and otherwise annihilate objects that would be difficult or even impossible for
                        others to demolish. You’re a breaker. You do not flinch; you punch right through that wall,
                        smash that machine, and fold the enemy’s metallic sword in half in an impressive and
                        intimidating display. Depending on the method that gives you this ability, your act might be
                        accompanied by flashes of energy, sound, or acidic odors. Once you display your impressive
                        skills as a destroyer, your enemies sometimes surrender rather than face an apparent force of
                        nature like yourself.

                        You likely wear armor, but probably not the heaviest armor you can because you don’t want

                        connections between structures that allowed the unknowable peoples of those bygone eras to step
                        from one to the next... Well, you don’t know for certain what it must have been like, but you
                        gain just as much pleasure imagining the future you will build, using the seeds of ancient

                        arms or legs.

                    <p>
                        Gravity must have been quite a concern for the people of prior epochs because there are many
                        paths within the numenera to control it. Through a quirk of fate, some unique device(s), or
                        supreme devotion (or a combination of all three), you have learned to tap into the power of
                        gravity. With one foot planted in the distant past, you are a mysterious individual. Most
                        likely, you are also older, having spent much of your life honing your odd, ancient talents.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You might prefer billowy garments that display your mastery of gravity’s pull and conceal your
                        identity and intentions.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        No one type of character is more likely to control gravity than another, but the power is rare.

                        You use the numenera to create holographic images that appear real. You are, in effect, an
                        artist—a crafter of light and sound. Holographic images can never inflict direct harm or exert
                        real force, but they can fool creatures, changing opinions and even behaviors if you craft them
                        cleverly.

                    <p>
                        You likely dress with flair and color. The appearance of things is important to you, both their
                        beauty and their ugliness. You are a visual performer who can entertain, terrify, or fool
                        everyone you encounter.

                        A Nano is the most likely character to be an illusionist, but Jacks find illusions to be helpful

                        the light—something you dubbed dark matter. It responded to you, almost like a living thing.
                        When you made shadow puppets, they were dark matter condensed and became briefly real. As you
                        grew older, you learned to harness your gift for more than play. You can condense dark matter
                        from thin air, pulling it from the void spaces or a transdimensional pocket that few others can
                        access. You don’t fear dark matter, but others should when you’re around.

                        You are a defender. Places are special to you, and seeing them overrun hurts your soul to its
                        core. Perhaps you had a bad experience once, where a place that you loved was lost in war. After
                        that, you vowed - never again. You sought out special training, and more than that, a connection
                        to the nanites that some possess but most people think of as magic. This connection is conferred
                        via mutation, a special device, psychic concentration, or some other method that links you to
                        the numenera. Your connection grows over time, granting you the ability to defend a city, a
                        wall, or even just a single but all-important gate.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You probably wear obvious armor, perhaps even distinctive in its defensive nature. A few spikes
                        and scowling faces worked into the pattern might discourage those seeking to get past you.

                        Glaives are the obvious character to prefer this focus, though a Wright defending an

                        Someone has to stand up for the helpless, the weak, and the unprotected. You believe this duty
                        falls to you, and thus you have spent much of your life watching out for the people around you.
                        When you see them in trouble, you are the first to come to their aid. You might give up your
                        last shin to help the hungry, take a beating to save a person from the same, or rally your
                        friends to take on injustice wherever you find it.

                    <p>
                        You probably bear many scars from previous conflicts, but for each scar, you likely also have a
                        token of gratitude. You may have a dried flower given to you by a lady you saved from brigands,
                        or a bit of metal given to you by a starving man you fed.

                        Glaives typically take up the cause of the weak, having the grit, determination, and durability
                        to face down dangerous threats. Jacks, however, may pursue these goals as vigilantes, while
                        Nanos bring to bear fabulous powers in the defense of others. Delves are least likely to take up
                        this cause, as they tend to be loners. On the other hand, Wrights and Arkai, many of whom have
                        the good of others in mind at all times, are sometimes drawn to more direct methods of defending
                        others.

                        You descend from privilege, wealth, and power. Your family once owned land (perhaps they still
                        do), wielded political control, and accumulated vast wealth. You’ve stepped away from that
                        somewhat, though you still carry a noble title, whether you want it or not. People sometimes
                        recognize your name, and sometimes they recognize you as being descended from nobility. But with
                        many areas being so isolated from each other, people in an area far from where you came from may
                        never even have heard of the place where your family is known.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Since you were raised a certain way, you probably dress smartly and carry yourself in such a way
                        that inspires, endears, or intimidates. You have a voice suited to drawing attention (unless you
                        choose to disguise it).

                    <p>
                        Descends From Nobility pairs well with a type such as Glaive or Nano because it provides an
                        additional dimension of history to a character who can otherwise become single-minded in their
                        focus to increase their knowledge of fighting or the numenera, respectively.

                    <p>
                        There is a gap in your memory lasting well over a year. One moment, you were marveling at the
                        appearance of a floating obelisk. The next, you were waking up in a shallow crater, being helped
                        up by a traveler. They witnessed you emerging from the side of that same obelisk, then falling
                        and smiting the ground. Instead of dying, you made a crater, because your body was somehow
                        changed and had become crystalline.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You’ve tried to return to the obelisk in an attempt to determine what happened to you, but
                        failed. Eventually, you hope to return. Until then, you explore, hoping to learn more about the
                        numenera in general and master more of your own crystalline nature in particular.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Any character type can have emerged from an obelisk, though the crystalline body they enjoy is
                        most likely to be appreciated by Glaives and Delves. Weird creatures are something that
                        explorers might expect to see on a regular basis, and someone who has emerged from an obelisk
                        qualifies. However, residents in small communities and others who do not travel often will
                        likely be highly suspicious and perhaps even afraid of such a character, at least initially.

                        NONHUMANOID CRYSTALLINE FORM If your character who Emerges From the Obelisk is significantly
                        different from a regular human shape—such as if you choose to be a levitating crystal
                        shard—you’ll
                        have to work with your GM to come up with an alternative method for manipulating objects like a
                        regular human could, whether that’s short-range telekinesis or crystalline tendrils.

                        You are an entertainer - a singer, dancer, poet, storyteller, or something similar. You perform
                        for the benefit of others. Naturally charismatic and talented, you have also studied to master
                        your art. You know all the old poems, songs, jokes, and stories, and you’re skilled at creating
                        new ones, too.

                    <p>
                        You probably wear flamboyant or at least fashionable clothes and use cosmetics, tattoos, or hair

                        giving you a ghostly translucence.

                    <p>
                        With concentration, you can pass your hand through a solid object, allow a solid object to pass
                        harmlessly through you, or literally walk through walls. However, moving in and out of different
                        phase states requires extreme force of will and can be mentally taxing. The explanation for your
                        strange power lies within some aspect of the numenera. Perhaps the ability emerged through the
                        use of (or exposure to) lingering transdimensional technology or as the result of an encounter
                        with a creature not native to this world or dimension. Perhaps one of your ancestors first
                        developed the power and passed it down through generations.

                        You might do whatever you can to play up your translucent appearance by wearing diaphanous,

                        You explore the foreboding ruins and mysterious locales of the ancient eras, trained in such
                        activities by those who have gone before you. You’re the archetypical treasure hunter,
                        scavenger, and finder of lost things. You spend so much of your time in the dark that you slowly
                        adapt to it, almost becoming a creature of the gloom yourself. Even in civilized areas, you
                        prefer to keep to the shadows.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Most likely, you wear dark clothing to help you blend into the blackness. On the other hand, you
                        might wear sensible garments and gear because you have serious and dangerous business to attend
                        to in the dark.

                        Jacks are suited to exploring dark places; those who do so are called shadowjacks. Glaives who
                        follow this path are known as shadow warriors, and Nanos are called shadowcasters.

                        What things were like long ago fires your imagination. You are equally thrilled to learn about
                        how a dead civilization lived as you are to regain a still-functioning oddity, cypher, or iotum
                        that the dead civilization used. For you, knowledge is an end in itself, but that doesn’t make
                        you naive to the dangers exploration poses. The opposite is true, which is why you’re no slouch
                        when it comes to defending yourself. You’re a born excavator and explorer, adept at moving and
                        maneuvering, making discoveries, and resisting the dangers that forgotten places often hold.

                        You probably wear sensible garments that can stand up to both rain and sun, as well as a hat or

                        respect. The society might have been a tribe of abhumans, a military unit, a secret group of
                        warriors that live in a limited dimension, or something else. Whatever the specifics (which you
                        and your GM should work together to decide), you formed close personal ties with them and
                        trained to fight in small and large groups alike. But at some point, you left, perhaps to seek
                        your destiny, because you were exiled, or because everyone in the society spends a significant
                        time away before returning to retire. Though you are gone, the lessons of teamwork and
                        leadership that you learned while part of that society remain with you.

                        You know that style is at least as important as substance. Defeating foes is secondary to
                        looking good while doing it. Some might call you a swashbuckler or daredevil. You leap through
                        the air, make a flourish with your weapon, and attack, usually with a clever, biting show of
                        wit. Your enemies hate you, but your allies adore you. Just watching you fight is entertaining.

                        Jacks and Glaives make the best swashbucklers, and they are the most common types of characters

                        Telekinesis. Psychokinesis. Mind over matter. The power has many names, but in the end, it all
                        boils down to one thing—the molecules that make up all matter are yours to command. You likely
                        call yourself a telekinetic or just a TK.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Many telekinetics prefer to wear tight clothing without much accoutrement, so there is little
                        that another TK could grab hold of psychically. On the other hand, you have the power to create
                        very minor telekinetic effects at will, so your hair might always be in motion, you could have a
                        few tiny objects floating around you, or you might wear a long cape that’s always billowing.

                    <p>
                        Jacks are the most likely characters to be telekinetics, but Glaives find that the abilities add

                        At some point in your past, some of your
                        organic parts were replaced with artificial
                        components. (Alternatively, you belong to
                        a secret species of biomechanical hybrids.)
                        These artificial components might be
                        subdermal, or they might resemble more overt
                        metal or synth plating on your skin. They can
                        also take the form of threadlike tendrils of
                        circuitry winding across your flesh. Whatever
                        their appearance, these components give you
                        special abilities. As you advance, you can add
                        to, modify, or discover new functions for them.
                        Unfortunately, your artificial body also has
                        special requirements when it takes damage.

                        You might wear a cloak with a hood or

                        from those who would persecute you. Because
                        your components are tricky to repair, as time
                        goes on, it might become more difficult
                        to conceal your true nature, with exposed
                        circuitry, metal plates, and more in a state of
                        partial disassembly.

                        right into the datasphere. Mentally, you function on an entirely different level than your

                        nature of the creature, including its appearance,

                        Style and appearance are probably low on

                        bestial abhumans attack villages, caravans, and travelers all the time in the wilderness. But
                        the threat is also far subtler. The progenitors of the abhumans were once human. They gave up
                        their humanity to become horrific, monstrous things. How this happened, or how long ago, are
                        things you cannot conceive. But you know that they are true, so abhumans must be eradicated for

                        warriorlike than their fellows. Abhuman hunters spend much of their time stalking through the

                        villages of the Ninth World.

                        Using charisma, natural leadership, and perhaps some training, you command the actions of
                        others, who follow you willingly. You are a commander, a captain, a leader, or a general. Your
                        skills allow you to make people do
                        what you want, but you also have the wisdom to know what actions would be best for your
                        followers and allies.

                    <p>
                        Since you need the respect of others, you probably dress and carry yourself in such a way that
                        inspires, endears, or intimidates. You have a voice suited to barking orders that can be heard
                        even on a noisy battlefield.

                        Arkai are already leaders, so only a few will choose to further enhance their expertise. Glaives
                        make excellent military leaders, but a Jack could easily lead a group of explorers or a den of
                        thieves. A Nano might be the head of a group of “mages” or scholars, or they might have a gang
                        of bodyguards as followers.

                        You’ve been around, which means that you’ve experienced the pendulum swings that living delivers
                        to every creature. No matter the heights that someone might attain, situations change, disasters
                        happen, friends die, and mistakes are made. No matter how brilliant you might be, or believe
                        yourself to be, those mistakes are often made by you. What distinguishes you from others is that
                        you learn from those mistakes. You learn from the past and use experience as your guide. You’re
                        older than many, but you’ve seen some amazing things in that time, and you can draw on that
                        experience to do amazing things.

                    <p>
                        As someone who’s survived the long years and trials of life, you probably dress simply and
                        practically. Though older than most others who risk exploration, you remain fit, lean, and
                        probably have either no hair or hair as white as the frozen water that’s said to cover the land
                        in the far south. Those who've endured defeat, struggled against the odds, known loss, and
                        suffered deeply are primed to learn from adversity. Not everyone is able to appreciate such
                        bitter lessons, but the few who do so can go far. Glaives, Jacks, and Arkai are most likely to
                        prefer the focus Learns From Adversity.

                        understand the mysteries of nature, weather, and survival. The ways of flora and fauna are your

                        Your rough, rugged clothing shows little concern for style. Most of the time, covering yourself
                        in natural smells to keep your scent from arousing suspicion in the wilderness is more important
                        than bathing to keep yourself presentable to other humans.

                        Glaives and Jacks are the most likely characters to live in the wilderness, perhaps working as
                        guides, hunters, trappers, scouts, or trackers. A Nano who does so might be seen as a nature

                        good at it. Cautious and prudent, you learn techniques to defend against all kinds of attacks,
                        both physical and mental. The winner is often the last person standing, and you’ve done all you
                        can to ensure that person will be you. You carry a shield and probably wear the best armor you

                        of knives, or whatever is appropriate to your chosen weapon. A master of the rapier is different
                        than a master of the warhammer, and an archer is different than a whip wielder.

                    <p>
                        You might wear a symbol—a badge, a pin, a tattoo, an amulet, certain colors, or the like— that
                        indicates the school in which you trained, the style of fighting you have mastered, or the name
                        of your mentor. Your weapon is almost certainly your finest possession. Not only is it well
                        cared for and of high quality, but you probably keep it in a beautiful scabbard, harness, belt,
                        case, or something similar.

                        Many Glaives are weapon masters, but sometimes a Jack might choose this path, particularly with

                        There is so much injustice in the world. It takes a special person to take it upon himself to
                        right wrongs, protect the innocent, and punish the guilty. You are such a person.

                        Justicars, as they are sometimes called, are knights errant who wear armor, bear swords and
                        shields, and travel the land looking for tyranny, corruption, and oppression. But some operate a
                        little less ostentatiously, and sometimes justice comes from more subtle tactics. A justicar
                        might also be a masked vigilante or just a badass who rights wrongs.

                    <p>
                        The importance of justice in your life might come from religion, your upbringing, or your highly

                        likely to have a lot of friends.

                    <p>
                        You probably wear dark colors—black, charcoal grey, or midnight blue—to help blend into the

                        and they rarely use weapons other than their body’s own implements (although some carry items
                        designed to enhance their body movements for greater effect, such as knuckle weapons, knee

                        be able to touch other creatures with it to sense their presence, heal them, detect their
                        feelings, and possibly even hurt those who are revealed to be enemies.

                        You might consider your biomorphic field a curse, the effect of a strange numenera item embedded
                        in your flesh, a metallic amulet that keeps turning up no matter how many times you try to lose
                        it, a genetic mutation (or genetic tweak from your forebears), or maybe even as the direct
                        intervention of some prior-world deity that you hope to meet one day. However it came to be,
                        it’s a fact that dangerous risks are lessened for you, though not completely without
                        consequence; if you are damaged enough, the flame of vitality that you radiate will be snuffed
                        out.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You wear tough clothing that can withstand a lot, because even though you are mighty, regular
                        clothing and possessions are not. Usually your biomorphic field is little more than a subtle
                        sparkle, but when you use an ability, you radiate a momentary flash of gold light.

                        Though anyone might find that coming back from death, at least in the short term, is a desirable
                        trait, those who put themselves into harm’s way most directly, like Glaives and Delves, are
                        likely to benefit the most from it.

                        The ancients harnessed electricity in strange and wonderful ways. Through practice and inherent
                        ability (or the subtle use of hidden or implanted devices), you control the same energy. Not
                        only can you create and discharge electrical power, but you can eventually learn to use it to

                        found in the rainbow, and more things in the world than most can see, sense, or even understand.
                        With practice and help (through drugs, lenses, manipulated energy fields, or a combination of
                        all three), you can perceive things that others cannot. What you see in other dimensions has

                        It’s not just the place, but also the people you want to keep safe and healthy and see have
                        success in their life. Certainly, there are individuals within the community who are more
                        troublesome than others, but unless they become an actual danger to the others, you include them
                        in those you shepherd. To accomplish your goal, you’ve honed not only your ability to fight in
                        order to preserve the community against invaders, but also your ability to understand the
                        concerns of the community and persuade them toward smart decisions about the problems that face

                        When you move, your body changes state and becomes partially phased, reflecting a bizarre
                        alternate dimension where distance and time are different than they are in the Ninth World. It’s
                        only when you’re still that you remain solid and fully part of the real world. Sometimes that’s
                        a relief, but other times you feel like you’re stuck in wet sand. Moving is your key to changing
                        phase—and perhaps happiness. While you’re phased, you skate along the surface of reality far
                        more quickly than others. Such rapid movement across normal reality sometimes leaves behind
                        scratches, which you can selectively make, suppress, or bear down upon to create particularly
                        devastating attacks and, eventually, phase detonations.

                    <p>
                        You got your ability because you’re descended from an entity that hailed from the bizarre
                        dimension of altered distance and time, because you were touched and ultimately spared by an
                        encounter with the iron wind, or because of a mechanism that you carry or that is embedded in
                        you.

                        You probably wear clothing designed to stay out of your way, because the less you carry, the

                        have power. There’s a chance you don’t care much about your appearance, as long as you can say
                        what you want to say.

                        Existence is a soundscape of noise whose meanings are not only clear, but insistent. You can’t
                        ignore them. Then again, why would you want to? You’ve learned how to manipulate sound by
                        emitting both constructive and destructive interference. At first, your manipulations of the
                        soundscape are brutal and straightforward, but the more you learn, the more you know that

                        fused to your flesh, a mutation, or just your training with the nanomachines that suffuse
                        everything. You issue commands through that connection, and the weather listens. The winds curl
                        to your desire; they lift you, protect you, and give you the power to summon storms or break
                        them apart. An electrical storm, a blizzard, or—when your mastery reaches its zenith—even a

                        perform esoteries are born with the ability, but you know that skill and intelligence play
                        important roles. The ancients created the numenera through knowledge, discovery, and intellect,
                        and to use it properly, you must follow the same path.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You probably wear spectacles and dapper outfits, carrying extra books, notebooks, and pens so
                        you can continually focus on your studies and experiments.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Nanos usually receive this instruction and focus, but some Jacks do as well. Glaives never do.

                    <p>
                        You bear steel with both hands, ready to take on any foe. You fight with two weapons in melee,
                        sometimes called dual wielding. A fearsome warrior, quick and strong, you believe that the best
                        defense is a strong offense.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You probably sheathe one weapon on each side or both crossed behind your back. They are likely
                        your most prized possessions, and you might have names for them.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Many Glaives and Jacks train to fight with two weapons at once. Very rarely would other
                        characters spend the time required to learn such a purely physical art, but it’s possible.

                        You are a talker. Maybe you got your start telling stories, arguing with your siblings, running
                        a shop, and so on. You learned how people think, how they respond to some lines of argument and
                        words more than others, and how to apply that influence selectively. You negotiate for your
                        sake, on behalf of others, or for a cause you believe in. Charismatic, your natural talent shows
                        through any time you open your mouth to speak. You know when it’s appropriate to joke, when to
                        be serious, and, sometimes, when an insult is required to wound someone’s pride in just the
                        right way to get what you want.You probably wear flamboyant or at least fashionable clothes, and
                        you use cosmetics, tattoos, or
                        hair stylings for dramatic effect.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Wielding words like weapons is a great way for a character to get what they want in the short or
                        medium term. However, unless one watches their words especially closely, it’s also a great way
                        to make enemies who remember the word-slinger for insults to their honor—honor that might one
                        day need to be upheld.

                    <p>
                        Arkai and Jacks are most likely to have this focus, given that it enhances abilities they likely
                        already possess.

                        You manipulate matter and time to help others and are beloved by everyone you encounter. Some
                        people consider you a representative of the gods or a power from beyond this world. Perhaps
                        they’re right—transdimensional experiments in the prior worlds might be what created the
                        energies that you now wield.

                    <p>
                        You probably wear simple clothes—nothing too flashy or stylish. There’s no need to call more
                        attention to yourself.

                        A Glaive who can heal himself is an interesting and dangerous proposition.

                        The thief, the burglar, the pickpocket - these are the dangerous individuals who haunt the back
                        alleys of every community. You are a thief in a city or town, making your livelihood at the
                        expense of the wealthy. Your talents, however, prepare you for all kinds of pursuits, even when
                        you’re not crouching in an alley or climbing into a window.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Usually, you dress to blend in with the crowd. When you’re on a mission, black, form-fitting
                        clothing allows you to swim in the shadows.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Most thieves are Jacks, but Nanos make interesting burglars as well. A Glaive thief likely adds
                        a little more physicality to their crimes.
