        <main>

            <p>This page explains how to create characters to play
                in a Numenera game. This involves a series of decisions
                that will shape your character, so the more you
                understand what kind of character you want to
                play, the easier character creation will be. The
                process involves understanding the values of
                three game statistics and choosing three aspects
                that determine your character’s capabilities.</p>

            <img src="images\character-creation-process-0.jpg">

            <h2>CHARACTER STATS</h2>
            <p>Every player character has three defining
                characteristics, which are typically called “statistics”
                or “stats.” These stats are Might, Speed, and
                Intellect. They are broad categories that cover many
                different but related aspects of a character.</p>

            <p><b>MIGHT:</b> Might defines how strong and durable
                your character is. The concepts of strength,
                endurance, constitution, hardiness, and physical
                prowess are all folded into this one stat. Might
                isn’t relative to size; instead, it’s an absolute
                measurement. An elephant has more Might
                than the mightiest tiger, which has more
                Might than the mightiest rat, which has
                more Might than the mightiest spider.
                Might governs actions from forcing doors
                open to walking for days without food to
                resisting disease. It’s also the primary means of
                determining how much damage your character
                can sustain in a dangerous situation. Physical
                characters, tough characters, and characters
                interested in fighting should focus on Might. Might could be thought
                of as Might/Health because it governs how strong you are and how much physical
                punishment you can take.</p>

            <p><b>SPEED:</b> Speed describes how fast and
                physically coordinated your character is. The
                stat embodies quickness, movement, dexterity,
                and reflexes. Speed governs such divergent
                actions as dodging attacks, sneaking around
                quietly, and throwing a ball accurately. It helps
                determine whether you can move farther on
                your turn. Nimble, fast, or sneaky characters
                will want good Speed stats, as will those
                interested in ranged combat. Speed could be thought of
                as Speed/Agility because
                it governs your overall
                swiftness and reflexes.</p>


            <p><b>INTELLECT:</b> This stat determines how smart,
                knowledgeable, and likable your character is.
                It includes intelligence, wisdom, charisma,
                education, reasoning, wit, willpower, and
                charm. Intellect governs solving puzzles,
                remembering facts, telling convincing lies, and
                using mental powers. Characters interested
                in communicating effectively, being learned
                scholars, and wielding the numenera should
                stress their Intellect stat.</p>

            <br />
            <h3>POOL, EDGE, AND EFFORT</h3>
            <p>
                Each of your stats has two components: your
                Pool and your Edge. Your Pool represents your
                raw, innate ability, and your Edge represents
                knowing how to use what you have. A third
                element ties into this concept: Effort. When
                your character really needs to accomplish a
                task, you apply Effort.
            </p>
            <b>POOL</b>
            <p>
                Your Pool is the most basic measurement of a
                stat. Comparing the Pools of two creatures will
                give you a general sense of which creature is
                superior in that stat. For example, a character
                who has a Might Pool of 16 is stronger (in a
                basic sense) than a character who has a Might
                Pool of 12. Most characters start with a Pool
                of 9 to 12 in most stats—that’s the average
                range.
            </p>
            <p>
                When your character is injured, sickened,
                or attacked, you temporarily lose points from
                one of your stat Pools. The nature of the
                attack determines which Pool loses points.
                For example, physical damage from a sword
                reduces your Might Pool, a poison that makes
                you clumsy reduces your Speed Pool, and a
                mental blast reduces your Intellect Pool. You
                can also spend points from one of your stat
                Pools to decrease a task’s difficulty (using Effort).
                You can rest to regain lost points
                from a stat Pool, and some special abilities or numenera
                might allow you to recover lost points quickly.
            </p>

            <b>EDGE</b>
            <p>
                Although your Pool is the basic measurement
                of a stat, your Edge is also important. When
                something requires you to spend points from
                a stat Pool, your Edge for that stat reduces
                the cost. It also reduces the cost of applying
                Effort to a roll.
            </p>
            <p>
                For example, let’s say you have a mental
                blast ability, and activating it costs 1 point
                from your Intellect Pool. Subtract your Intellect
                Edge from the activation cost, and the result is
                how many points you must spend to use the
                mental blast. If using your Edge reduces the
                cost to 0, you can use the ability for free.
            </p>
            <p>
                Your Edge can be different for each stat. For
                example, you could have a Might Edge of 1, a
                Speed Edge of 1, and an Intellect Edge of 0.
                You’ll always have an Edge of at least 1 in one
                stat. Your Edge for a stat reduces the cost of
                spending points from that stat Pool, but not
                from other Pools. Your Might Edge reduces the
                cost of spending points from your Might Pool,
                but it doesn’t affect your Speed Pool or Intellect
                Pool. Once a stat’s Edge reaches 3, you can
                apply one level of Effort (see below) for free.
            </p>

            <p>
                A character who has a low Might Pool but a
                high Might Edge has the potential to perform
                Might actions consistently better than a
                character who has a Might Edge of 0. The high
                Edge will reduce the cost of spending points
                from the Pool, which means they’ll have more
                points available to spend on applying Effort.
                It may help to think of Edge as a negative
                number—it’s something you subtract from the cost of spending points
                from your Pool.
            </p>

            <img src="images\character-creation-process-1.jpg">

            <b>EFFORT</b>
            <p>
                When your character really needs to
                accomplish a task, you can apply Effort to
                reduce the difficulty of a task (also called
                easing a task). For a beginning character,
                applying Effort requires spending 3 points
                from the stat Pool appropriate to the action.
                Thus, if your character tries to dodge an
                attack (a Speed roll) and wants to increase
                the chance for success, you can apply Effort
                by spending 3 points from your Speed Pool.
                Using Effort eases the task by one step. This is
                called applying one level of Effort.
            </p>

            <p>
                You don’t have to apply Effort if you don’t
                want to. If you choose to apply Effort to a task,
                you must do it before you attempt the roll—
                you can’t roll first and then decide to apply
                Effort if you rolled poorly.
            </p>
            <p>
                Applying more Effort can lower a task’s
                difficulty further: each additional level of Effort
                eases the task by another step. Applying one
                level of Effort eases the task by one step,
                applying two levels eases the task by two
                steps, and so on. Each level of Effort after the
                first costs only 2 points from the stat Pool
                instead of 3. So applying two levels of Effort
                costs 5 points (3 for the first level plus 2 for
                the second level), applying three levels costs 7
                points (3 plus 2 plus 2), and so on.
            </p>
            <p>
                Every character has an Effort score, which
                indicates the maximum number of levels of
                Effort that can be applied to a roll. A beginning
                (first-tier) character has an Effort of 1, meaning
                you can apply only one level of Effort to a roll.
                A more experienced character has a higher
                Effort score and can apply more levels of Effort
                to a roll. For example, a character who has an
                Effort of 3 can apply up to three levels of Effort
                to ease a task.
            </p>
            <p>
                When you apply Effort, subtract your relevant
                Edge from the total cost of applying Effort. For
                example, let’s say you need to make a Speed
                roll. To increase your chance for success, you
                decide to apply one level of Effort, which will
                ease the task by one step. Normally, that would
                cost 3 points from your Speed Pool. However,
                if you have a Speed Edge of 2, you subtract that
                from the cost. Thus, applying Effort to the roll
                costs only 1 point from your Speed Pool.
            </p>
            <p>
                What if you applied two levels of Effort to the
                Speed roll instead of just one? That would ease
                the task by two steps. Normally, it would cost 5
                points from your Speed Pool, but after subtracting
                your Speed Edge of 2, it costs only 3 points.
                Once a stat’s Edge reaches 3, you can apply
                one level of Effort for free. For example, if you
                have a Speed Edge of 3 and you apply one level
                of Effort to a Speed roll, it costs you 0 points
                from your Speed Pool. (Normally, applying
                one level of Effort would cost 3 points, but
                you subtract your Speed Edge from that cost,
                reducing it to 0.)
            </p>
            <p>
                Skills and other advantages also ease a task,
                and you can use them in conjunction with
                Effort. In addition, your character might have
                special abilities or equipment that allow you
                to apply Effort to accomplish a special effect,
                such as knocking down a foe with an attack
                or affecting multiple targets with a power that
                normally affects only one.
            </p>


            <b>EFFORT AND DAMAGE</b>
            <p>
                Instead of applying Effort to ease your attack,
                you can apply Effort to increase the amount
                of damage you inflict with an attack. For each
                level of Effort you apply in this way, you inflict
                3 additional points of damage. This works
                for any kind of attack that inflicts damage,
                whether a sword, a crossbow, a mind blast, or
                something else.
            </p>
            <p>
                When using Effort to increase the damage of
                an area attack, such as the explosion created
                by a Nano’s Flash ability, you inflict 2 additional
                points of damage instead of 3 points. However,
                the additional points are dealt to all targets in
                the area. Further, even if one or more of the
                targets in the area resist the attack, you still
                inflict 1 point of damage to them.
            </p>

            <b>MAKING ATTACKS</b>
            <p>
                When applying Effort to melee attacks, you have
                the option of spending points from either your
                Might Pool or your Speed Pool. When making
                ranged attacks, you may spend points only from
                your Speed Pool. This reflects that with melee
                you sometimes use brute force and sometimes use
                finesse, but with ranged attacks, it’s always about
                careful targeting.
            </p>

            <b>MULTIPLE USES OF EFFORT AND EDGE</b>
            <p>
                If your Effort is 2 or higher, you can apply Effort
                to multiple aspects of a single action. For
                example, if you make an attack, you can apply
                Effort to your attack roll and apply Effort to
                increase the damage.
            </p>
            <p>
                The total amount of Effort you apply can’t be
                higher than your Effort score. For example, if
                your Effort is 2, you can apply up to two levels of
                Effort. You could apply one level to an attack roll
                and one level to its damage, two levels to the
                attack and no levels to the damage, or no levels
                to the attack and two levels to the damage.
            </p>
            <p>
                You can use Edge for a particular stat
                only once per action. For example, if you
                apply Effort to a Might attack roll and to
                your damage, you can use your Might Edge
                to reduce the cost of one of those uses of
                Effort, not both. If you spend 1 Intellect point
                to activate your mind blast and one level of
                Effort to ease the attack roll, you can use your
                Intellect Edge to reduce the cost of one of
                those things, not both.
            </p>

            <p>
                Your stat Pools, as well as your Effort and
                Edge, are determined by the character type,
                descriptor, and focus that you choose. Within
                those guidelines, however, you have a lot
                of flexibility in how you develop your character.
            </p>


            <br>
            <h2>STAT EXAMPLES</h2>
            <p>
                A beginning character is fighting a creature
                called a broken hound. She stabs her spear at
                the broken hound, which is a level 2 creature
                and thus has a target number of 6. The
                character stands atop a boulder and strikes
                downward at the beast, and the GM rules
                that this helpful tactic is an asset that eases
                the attack by one step (to difficulty 1). That
                lowers the target number to 3. Attacking with
                a spear is a Might action; the character has
                a Might Pool of 11 and a Might Edge of 0.
                Before making the roll, she decides to apply
                a level of Effort to ease the attack. That costs
                3 points from her Might Pool, reducing the
                Pool to 8. But they appear to be points well
                spent. Applying the Effort lowers the difficulty
                from 1 to 0, so no roll is needed—the attack
                automatically succeeds.
            </p>
            <p>
                Another character is attempting to convince
                a guard to let him into a private office to speak
                to an influential noble. The GM rules that this
                is an Intellect action. The character is third tier
                and has an Effort of 3, an Intellect Pool of 13,
                and an Intellect Edge of 1. Before making the
                roll, he must decide whether to apply Effort. He
                can choose to apply one, two, or three levels
                of Effort, or apply none at all. This action is
                important to him, so he decides to apply two
                levels of Effort, easing the task by two steps.
                Thanks to his Intellect Edge, applying the Effort
                costs only 4 points from his Intellect Pool (3
                points for the first level of Effort plus 2 points
                for the second level minus 1 point for his Edge).
                Spending those points reduces his Intellect
                Pool to 9. The GM decides that convincing the
                guard is a difficulty 3 (demanding) task with
                a target number of 9; applying two levels of
                Effort reduces the difficulty to 1 (simple) and
                the target number to 3. The player rolls a d20
                and gets an 8. Because this result is at least
                equal to the target number of the task, he
                succeeds. However, if he had not applied some
                Effort, he would have failed because his roll (8)
                would have been less than the task’s original
                target number (9).

            <h2>CHARACTER TIERS AND BENEFITS</h2>
            <p>
                Every character starts the game at the first tier.
                Tier is a measurement of power, toughness,
                and ability. Characters can advance up to
                the sixth tier. As your character advances to
                higher tiers, you gain more abilities, increase
                your Effort, and can improve a stat’s Edge
                or increase a stat. Generally speaking, even
                first-tier characters are quite capable. It’s
                safe to assume that they’ve already got some
                experience under their belt. This is not a “zero
                to hero” progression, but rather an instance
                of competent people refining and honing their
                capabilities and knowledge. Advancing to
                higher tiers is not really the goal of Numenera
                characters, but rather a representation of how
                characters progress in a story.
            </p>
            <p>
                To progress to the next tier, characters
                earn experience points (XP) by exploring new
                places and discovering new things—the Ninth
                World is about discovery of the past and what
                it means for the future. Experience points
                have many uses, and one use is to purchase
                character benefits. After your character
                purchases four character benefits, they go up
                to the next tier.

            <br>
            <h2>CHARACTER DESCRIPTOR, TYPE, AND FOCUS</h2>
            <p>
                To create your character, you build a simple
                statement that describes them. The statement
                takes this form: “I am a [fill in an adjective here]
                [fill in a noun here] who [fill in a verb here].”
                Thus: “I am an adjective noun who verbs.”
            </p>
            <p>For example, you might say, “I am a Rugged Glaive
                who Controls Beasts” or “I am a Charming
                Nano who Focuses Mind Over Matter.”. In this sentence:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    The adjective is called your descriptor.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The noun is your character type.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The verb is called your focus.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>SPECIAL ABILITIES</h3>
            <p>
                Character types and foci grant PCs special
                abilities at each new tier. Using these abilities
                usually costs points from your stat Pools; the
                cost is listed in parentheses after the ability
                name. Your Edge in the appropriate stat can
                reduce the cost of the ability, but remember
                that you can apply Edge only once per action.
                For example, let’s say a Nano with an Intellect
                Edge of 2 wants to use their Onslaught ability
                to create a bolt of force, which costs 1 Intellect
                point. They also want to increase the damage
                from the attack by using a level of Effort, which
                costs 3 Intellect points. The total cost for their
                action is 2 points from their Intellect Pool (1
                point for the bolt of force plus 3 points for
                using Effort minus 2 points from their Edge).
            </p>
            <p>
                Sometimes the point cost for an ability has a
                + sign after the number. For example, the cost
                might be stated as “2+ Intellect points.” That
                means you can spend more points or more
                levels of Effort to improve the ability further.
            </p>
            <p>
                Many special abilities grant a character the
                option to perform an action that they couldn’t
                normally do, such as projecting rays of cold or
                attacking multiple foes at once. Using one of
                these abilities is an action unto itself, and the end
                of the ability’s description says “Action” to remind
                you. It also might provide more information about
                when or how you perform the action.
            </p>

            <p>
                Some special abilities allow you to perform
                a familiar action—one that you can already
                do—in a different way. For example, an ability
                might let you wear heavy armor, ease Speed
                defense rolls, or add 2 points of fire damage to
                your weapon damage. These abilities are called
                enablers. Using one of these abilities is not
                considered an action. Enablers either function
                constantly (such as being able to wear heavy
                armor, which isn’t an action) or happen as part
                of another action (such as adding fire damage
                to your weapon damage, which happens as
                part of your attack action). If a special ability is
                an enabler, the end of the ability’s description
                says “Enabler” to remind you.
            </p>

            <br>
            <h3>TYPE</h3>
            <p>
                Character type is the core of your character.
                In some roleplaying games, it might be called
                your character class. Your type helps determine
                your character’s place in the world and
                relationship with other people in the setting.
                It’s the noun of the sentence “I am an adjective
                noun who verbs.”
            </p>
            <p>
                You can choose from six character types:
                Glaive, Jack, Nano, Delve, Wright, Arcus.
            </p>


            <b>Glaive</b>
            <p>Glaives are the elite warriors of the Ninth World,
                using weapons and armor to fight their enemies.
                Hunters, guardians, and soldiers could be
                Glaives. Sometimes scouts, warlords, bandits,
                and even athletes are Glaives. “Glaive” is a
                common slang term used almost everywhere
                in the Steadfast and the Beyond for any person
                skilled with weapons or a martial art, but in truth,
                it applies only to the best of the best. Glaives
                are warriors who command abilities far beyond
                those of a typical person with a sword.<br>

            </p>

            <b>Nano</b>
            <p>
                Nanos are sometimes called mages, wizards,
                sorcerers, or witches by the people of the
                Ninth World. Nano-sorcerer is also a common
                term, with their abilities referred to as nanosorcery. Some claim to be the representatives
                of gods or other supernatural agencies.
                Whatever they’re called, Nanos master the
                mysteries of the past to the degree that they
                seem to perform miracles. They tap into the
                numenera to alter reality or learn things that
                they couldn’t otherwise know.<br>

            </p>

            <b>Jack</b>
            <p>Jacks are intrepid explorers. They are jacks of all
                trades—hence the name—although the word also
                hearkens back to fables involving a wily, resourceful
                hero who always seems to be named Jack. Used as
                a verb, “to jack” means to steal, to deceive, or to
                get out of a tight scrape through ingenuity or luck.
                Jacks don’t use one skill or tactic exclusively;
                they use whatever weapons, armor, esoteries,
                or anything else might help them. They are
                hunters (particularly treasure hunters), con
                artists, skalds, rogues, scouts, and experts in a
                variety of fields.<br>

            </p>

            <b>Delves</b>
            <p>Delves are willing to risk everything just to find
                something new, something that no one else
                has seen before. They are driven to expand the
                boundaries of the known, often rediscovering
                what was long forgotten. Delves delight in
                finding never-explored ruins of the prior worlds
                and cataloguing them from top to bottom.
                Mysteries presented by weird machines and
                broken scrap are nearly identical for Delves.
                They know that what others dismiss as debris
                might contain hidden treasure called iotum—
                like apt clay, protomatter, philosophine, data
                orbs, and more! That’s what most Delves seek.
                They won’t ignore cyphers and artifacts prized
                by others, of course, but Delves see deeper
                and are skilled at extracting the building blocks
                of the prior worlds.<br>

            </p>

            <b>Wright</b>
            <p>Wrights are builders and crafters. When
                something special is required, a Wright can
                make it. When strange instructions are found
                in the ruins of the prior worlds, Wrights can
                decipher them and, using special components
                called iotum, craft their own cyphers, artifacts,
                or installations. In a way, Wrights are especially
                good at understanding and stealing the fire
                of creation that burned so brightly in the
                civilizations that rose to unimaginable heights
                before the Ninth World. Wrights are the rarest
                of the already rare numenera scholars; they
                aren’t afraid of weird or incomprehensible
                tech—they try to take it apart and learn how to
                make more. <br>

            </p>

            <b>Arcus</b>
            <p>
                Arkai are natural leaders of the Ninth World,
                using wit, rhetoric, and the strength of
                working together to overcome problems.
                Heralds, nobles, and pioneers could be Arkai.
                Sometimes warlords, generals, and even
                guardians are Arkai. “Arkus” is common
                vernacular used by humans in the Steadfast
                and the Beyond for any person skilled in
                governing others, but in truth, the word
                applies only to those who are specially gifted
                in leadership. Arkai have the potential to
                spearhead armies, cities, or even entire
                regions, because their abilities surpass
                those who are merely good at running a long
                confidence game.<br>

            <h3>DESCRIPTOR</h3>
            <p>
                Descriptor defines your character — it flavors
                everything you do. It’s the adjective of the sentence “I
                am an adjective noun who verbs.”
                The differences between a Charming Glaive
                and a Graceful Glaive are considerable. The
                descriptor changes the way those characters go
                about every action.
            </p>
            <p>
                Descriptors offer a one-time package of
                extra abilities, skills, or modifications to your
                stat Pools. Not all of a descriptor’s offerings
                are positive character modifications. For
                example, some descriptors have inabilities—
                tasks that a character isn’t good at. You can
                think of inabilities as “negative skills”—
                instead of being one step better at that kind
                of task, you’re one step worse. If you become
                skilled at a task that you have an inability with,
                they cancel out. Remember that characters are
                defined as much by what they’re not good at as
                by what they are good at.

            </p>

            <br>
            <h3>FOCUS</h3>
            <p>
                Focus is what makes your character unique.
                No two PCs in a group should have the same focus. Your focus
                gives you benefits and new abilities when you create your character and
                each time you ascend to the next tier. It’s the
                verb of the sentence “I am an adjective noun
                who verbs.”
            </p>
            <p>
                When you choose a character focus, you
                get a special connection to one or more of
                your fellow PCs, a first-tier ability, and perhaps
                additional starting equipment. A few foci
                offer slight alterations of type special abilities
                (fighting moves for Glaives, tricks of the trade
                for Jacks, and esoteries for Nanos). Each focus
                also offers suggestions to the GM and the
                player for possible effects or consequences of
                really good or really bad die rolls.
            </p>
            <p>
                Each tier’s benefits are independent of and
                cumulative with benefits from other tiers
                (unless indicated otherwise). So if your first-tier
                ability grants you +1 to Armor and your
                fourth-tier ability also grants you +1 to Armor,
                when you reach fourth tier, you have a total of
                +2 to Armor.
            </p>
            <p>You can find focuses in the following table (marked with * are not available to new player):
