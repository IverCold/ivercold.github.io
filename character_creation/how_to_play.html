            <h3>MAIN CONCEPTS</h3>
            <p>Numenera uses a twenty-sided die (d20)
                to determine the results of most actions.
                Whenever a roll of any kind is called for and no
                die is specified, roll a d20.</p>

            <p>The game master (GM) sets a difficulty for any
                given task. There are 12 degrees of difficulty. Thus, the
                difficulty of a task can be rated on a scale of 1 to 12.</p>
            <p>
                Each difficulty has a target number associated
                with it. The target number is always three times
                the task’s difficulty, so a difficulty 4 task has a
                target number of 12. To succeed at the task, you
                must roll the target number or higher.
            </p>
            <p>Character skills, favorable circumstances, or
                excellent equipment can decrease the difficulty
                of a task. For example, if a character is trained
                in climbing, she turns a difficulty 6 climb into
                a difficulty 5 climb. This is called easing the
                difficulty by one step (or just easing the difficulty,
                which assumes it’s eased by one step). If she is
                specialized in climbing, she turns a difficulty 6
                climb into a difficulty 4 climb. This is called easing
                the difficulty by two steps. Decreasing the difficulty
                of a task can also be called simply easing a
                task. Some situations increase, or hinder, the
                difficulty of a task. If a task is hindered, it
                increases the difficulty by one step.
            </p>


            <p>
                A skill is a category of knowledge, ability, or
                activity relating to a task, such as climbing,
                geography, or persuasiveness. A character’s level of skill is either trained
                (reasonably skilled) or specialized (very skilled).
                If you are trained in a skill relating to a task,
                you ease the difficulty of that task by one step.
                If you are specialized, you ease the difficulty
                by two steps. A skill can never ease a task’s
                difficulty by more than two steps.
            </p>

            <p>
                You can also ease the difficulty of a given
                task by applying Effort (more about Effort on <a href="process.html">character creation process
                    page</a>)
            </p>


            <h3>WHEN DO YOU ROLL?</h3>
            <p>
                Any time your character attempts a task, the
                GM assigns a difficulty to that task, and you roll
                a d20 against the associated target number.
                When you jump from a burning vehicle,
                swing a battleaxe at a mutant beast, swim
                across a raging river, identify a strange device,
                convince a merchant to give you a lower price,
                craft an object, use a power to control a foe’s
                mind, or use a heat-beam emitter to carve a
                hole in a wall, you make a d20 roll.
            </p>

            <p>
                However, if you attempt something that
                has a difficulty of 0, no roll is needed—you
                automatically succeed. Many actions have a
                difficulty of 0. Examples include walking across
                the room and opening a door, using a special
                ability to negate gravity so you can fly, using
                an ability to protect your friend from radiation,
                or activating a device (that you already
                understand) to erect a force field. These are all
                routine actions and don’t require rolls.
                Using skills, assets, and Effort, you can
                ease the difficulty of potentially any task to 0
                and thus negate the need for a roll. Walking
                across a narrow wooden beam is tricky for
                most people, but for an experienced gymnast,
                it’s routine. You can even ease the difficulty of
                an attack on a foe to 0 and succeed without
                rolling.
            </p>
            <p>
                If there’s no roll, there’s no chance for failure.
                However, there’s also no chance for remarkable
                success (in Numenera, that usually means
                rolling a 19 or 20). More of that below.
            </p>


            <h3>SPECIAL ROLLS</h3>
            <p>
                When you roll a natural 19 (the d20 shows
                “19”) and the roll is a success, you also have a
                minor effect. In combat, a minor effect inflicts 3
                additional points of damage with your attack, or,
                if you’d prefer a special result, you could decide
                instead that you knock the foe back, distract
                them, or something similar. When not in combat,
                a minor effect could mean that you perform the
                action with particular grace. For example, when
                jumping down from a ledge, you land smoothly
                on your feet, or when trying to persuade
                someone, you convince them that you’re smarter
                than you really are. In other words, you not only
                succeed but also go a bit further.
            </p>


            <p>
                When you roll a natural 20 (the d20 shows
                “20”) and the roll is a success, you also have
                a major effect. This is similar to a minor effect,
                but the results are more remarkable. In combat,
                a major effect inflicts 4 additional points of
                damage with your attack, but again, you can
                choose instead to introduce a dramatic event
                such as knocking down your foe, stunning
                them, or taking an extra action. Outside of
                combat, a major effect means that something
                beneficial happens based on the circumstance.
                For example, when climbing up a cliff wall,
                you make the ascent twice as fast. When a roll
                grants you a major effect, you can choose to use
                a minor effect instead if you prefer.
            </p>


            <p>
                In combat (and only in combat), if you roll
                a natural 17 or 18 on your attack roll, you add 1
                or 2 additional points of damage, respectively.
                Neither roll has any special effect options—
                just the extra damage.
            </p>
            <p>
                Rolling a natural 1 is always bad. It means
                that the GM introduces a new complication
                into the encounter.
            </p>

            <img src="images/how-to-play-2.jpg">

            <h3>COMBAT</h3>
            <p>
                Making an attack in combat works the same
                way as any other roll: the GM assigns a
                difficulty to the task, and you roll a d20 against
                the associated target number.
            </p>

            <p>
                The difficulty of your attack roll depends on
                how powerful your opponent is. Just as tasks
                have a difficulty from 1 to 12, creatures have
                a level from 1 to 12. Most of the time, the
                difficulty of your attack roll is the same as the
                creature’s level. For example, if you attack a
                level 2 bandit, it’s a level 2 task, so your target
                number is 6.
            </p>

            <p>
                It’s worth noting that players make all die
                rolls. If a character attacks a creature, the player
                makes an attack roll. If a creature attacks a
                character, the player makes a defense roll.
            </p>

            <p>
                The damage dealt by an attack is not
                determined by a roll—it’s a flat number based
                on the weapon or attack used. For example, a
                spear always does 4 points of damage.
            </p>

            <p>
                Your Armor characteristic reduces the damage
                you take from attacks directed at you. You get
                Armor from wearing physical armor (such as
                a sturdy leather jerkin or chainmail) or from
                special abilities. Like weapon damage, Armor
                is a flat number, not a roll. If you’re attacked,
                subtract your Armor from the damage you take.
                For example, a leather jerkin gives you 1 point
                of Armor, meaning that you take 1 less point of
                damage from attacks. If a bandit hits you with a
                knife for 2 points of damage while you’re wearing
                a leather jerkin, you take only 1 point of damage.
                If your Armor reduces the damage from an attack
                to 0, you take no damage from that attack.
            </p>

            <p>
                When you see the word “Armor” capitalized
                in the game rules (other than as the name
                of a special ability), it refers to your Armor
                characteristic—the number you subtract from
                incoming damage. When you see the word
                “armor” with a lowercase “a,” it refers to any
                physical armor you might wear.
            </p>
            <p>
                Typical physical weapons come in three
                categories: light, medium, and heavy.
            </p>

            <p>
                <b>LIGHT WEAPONS</b> inflict only 2 points of
                damage, but they ease attack rolls by one step
                because they are fast and easy to use. Light
                weapons are punches, kicks, clubs, knives,
                handaxes, rapiers, and so on. Weapons that
                are particularly small are light weapons.
            </p>

            <p>
                <b>MEDIUM WEAPONS</b> inflict 4 points of
                damage. Medium weapons include swords,
                battleaxes, maces, crossbows, spears, and so
                on. Most weapons are medium. Anything that
                could be used in one hand (even if it’s often
                used in two hands, such as a quarterstaff or
                spear) is a medium weapon.
            </p>

            <p>
                <b>HEAVY WEAPONS</b> inflict 6 points of damage,
                and you must use two hands to attack with
                them. Heavy weapons are huge swords, great
                hammers, massive axes, halberds, heavy
                crossbows, and so on. Anything that must be
                used in two hands is a heavy weapon.
            </p>



            <h3>RANGE AND SPEED</h3>
            <p>
                Distance is simplified into four categories:
                immediate, short, long, and very long.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>IMMEDIATE DISTANCE</b> from a character
                is within reach or within a few steps. If a
                character stands in a small room, everything
                in the room is within immediate distance. At
                most, immediate distance is 10 feet (3 m).
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>SHORT DISTANCE</b> is anything greater than
                immediate distance but less than 50 feet (15 m)
                or so.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>LONG DISTANCE</b> is anything greater than short
                distance but less than 100 feet (30 m) or so.
            </p>

            <p>
                <b>VERY LONG DISTANCE</b> is anything greater than
                long distance but less than 500 feet (150 m) or so.
                (Beyond that range, distances are always specified—
                1,000 feet [300 m], a mile [1.5 km], and so on.)
            </p>

            <p>
                The idea is that it’s not necessary to measure
                precise distances. Immediate distance is right
                there, practically next to the character. Short
                distance is nearby. Long distance is farther off.
                Very long distance is really far off.
            </p>


            <p>
                All weapons and special abilities use these
                terms for ranges. For example, all melee
                weapons have immediate range — they are
                close-combat weapons, and you can use them
                to attack anyone within immediate distance. A
                thrown knife (and most other thrown weapons)
                has short range. A bow has long range. A Nano’s
                Onslaught ability also has short range.
            </p>

            <p>
                A character can move an immediate distance
                as part of another action. In other words, they
                can take a few steps over to the control panel
                and activate a switch. They can lunge across
                a small room to attack a foe. They can open a
                door and step through.
            </p>

            <p>
                A character can move a short distance as
                their entire action for a turn. They can also try
                to move a long distance as their entire action,
                but the player might have to roll to see if the
                character slips, trips, or stumbles as the result
                of moving so far so quickly.
            </p>

            <p>
                For example, if the PCs are fighting a group
                of abhumans, any character can likely attack
                any abhuman in the general melee—they’re
                all within immediate range. Exact positions
                aren’t important. Creatures in a fight are always
                moving, shifting, and jostling, anyway. However,
                if one abhuman stayed back to use its crossbow,
                a character might have to use their entire action
                to move the short distance required to attack
                that foe. It doesn’t matter if the abhuman is 20
                feet (6 m) or 40 feet (12 m) away—it’s simply
                considered short distance. It does matter if it’s
                more than 50 feet (15 m) away because that
                distance would require a long move.
            </p>

            <img src="images/how-to-play-3.jpg">

            <h3>EXPERIENCE POINTS</h3>
            <p>
                Experience points (XP) are rewards given to
                players when the GM intrudes on the story with
                a new and unexpected challenge (an event called
                a GM intrusion). For example, in the middle of
                combat, the GM might inform the player that
                they drop their weapon. However, to intrude in
                this manner, the GM must award the player 2 XP.
                The rewarded player, in turn, must immediately
                give one of those XP to another player and justify
                the gift (perhaps the other player had a good
                idea, told a funny joke, performed an action that
                saved a life, and so on).
            </p>

            <p>
                Alternatively, the player can refuse the GM
                intrusion. If they do so, they don’t get the 2 XP
                from the GM, and they must also spend 1 XP
                that they already have. If the player has no XP to
                spend, they can’t refuse the intrusion.
            </p>

                Another type of XP is which the GM give players between
                sessions. They are coming as a reward for recovering interesting
                artifacts or making discoveries during an
                adventure. You don’t earn XP for killing foes or
                overcoming standard challenges in the course of
                play. Discovery is the soul of Numenera.

            <h3>CYPHERS</h3>
            <p>
                Cyphers are a type of numenera
                that have a single minor use. A character can
                carry cyphers and use them during the game.
                You can’t bear many cyphers at a time because
                a large number of these weird items emit
                radiation or dangerous chemicals that don’t
                mix well. Gathering cyphers together in one
                place is extraordinarily unhealthy.
            </p>

            <p>
                Characters will find new cyphers frequently in
                the course of play, so players shouldn’t hesitate
                to use their cypher abilities. Because cyphers are
                always different, the characters will always have
                new special powers to try.
            </p>

            <p>
                Most cyphers are as simple to use as
                swallowing a pill, flipping a switch on a
                handheld device, or throwing a bomb. Some
                are more complex, with multiple buttons,
                switches, knobs, keypads, touchscreen
                controls, wires, and so on, and may take
                longer to understand, but otherwise they are
                still one-use items.
