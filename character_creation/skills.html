            <h2><strong>Skills</strong></h2>
            <p>
                Sometimes your character gains training in a specific skill or task. For example, your focus might mean
                that you’re trained in sneaking, in climbing and jumping, or in social interactions. Other times, your
                character can choose a skill to become trained in, and you can pick a skill from below or propose
                something more character-related.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you gain a skill that you’re already trained in, you become specialized in that skill,
                which eases related tasks by two steps instead of one.
            </p>

            <p>If Descriptor, Type or Focus gives you training in some narrow skill then you should take it. Common
                skills that include these narrow skills will give your specialization in this narrow skill.
                For example, if Descriptor gives you training in Climbing, then if you take training in Athletics
                later, you will get specialization in Climbing.
            </p>
            <p>Such cases also include social skills: pleasant &amp; positive social interactions, detecting
                hidden motives, etc.
            </p>

            <p>
                Only skills gained through character type abilities (such as the Glaive’s fighting moves), focus
                abilities, or other rare instances allow you to become <i>skilled with attack or defense tasks</i>.
            </p>

            <p>
                If you gain a special ability through your type, your focus, or some other aspect of your character, you
                can
                choose it in place of a skill and become trained or specialized in that ability. For example, if you
                have a
                mind blast, when it’s time to choose a skill to be trained in, you can select your mind blast as your
                skill.
                That would ease the task every time you used it. Each ability you have counts as a separate skill for
                this
                purpose. You can’t select “all mind powers” or “all esoteries” as one skill and become trained or
                specialized in such a broad category.
            </p>

            <p><strong>Special skills:</strong></p>
            <p>These skills require detailed knowledge. If you aren&rsquo;t trained or specialized in this
                skill, you have an inability in the skill (you&rsquo;re hindered whenever you attempt that
                task).</p>
