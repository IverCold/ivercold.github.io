                construct the infrastructure - including walls, homes, structures, and some basic installations - to
                house a community of 5,000 people. If citizens were to immigrate into the new community, fill it, and
                take up appropriate roles, the infrastructure and installations already in place would make it a rank 5
                community. A buildnought can be tasked with building specifc things, even if plans are not provided to
                it, because it can take a few months or years to figure out a plan for itself. It takes a buildnought
                about as long to build any given item or structure as a wright. A buildnought sees to its own iotum
                needs by building small armies of extractors, which it sends out to salvage from nearby ruins.

                specifc species (human, varjellen, and so on). Building the servitor with a different appearance
                (whether changing the skin color, height, facial features, or other cosmetic changes) requires modifying
                the plan. Depending on the plan and the intended appearance, this sort of Modification might be easy,
                difficult, or very challenging. For example, modifying a human servitor plan to build a margr automaton
                is easy, modifying a varjellen servitor plan to build a human automaton is difficult, and modifying a
                hulking lattimor servitor plan to build a gaunt sathosh automaton is very challenging.

                chambers, corridors, and stairs within it that can be customized for ideal living using fairly

                serve as seats, beds, counters, toilet facilities, and so on. The envirosphere can maintain air,
                temperature, and water for up to ten humans at a time even when the installation is sited in harsh
                environments such as deserts, arctic regions, underwater, or in the vacuum of space. Entering and
                exiting the envirosphere is done via one of two airlocks that prevent inimical exterior environments, if
                any, from entering the sphere. The sphere can be fixed in place during crafting or it can be crafted in
                the void of space. Envirosphere builders can choose to make an envirocube, enviropyramid, or some other
                regular shape rather than a sphere.

                connected to a chute, conveyor belt, or hopper. Raw materials (ore, logs, and so on) are fed into the
                large opening and processed into refined materials that are spit out on the opposite end, with the
                surplus material discarded out of a side aperture. The machinery works two to five times faster than
                direct human labor, and in some cases, the only limit to how fast it can process materials is how long
                it takes to feed more into the intake aperture. Most plans for materials extruders are multipurpose, but
                a specifc installation must be built to process one type of material. For example, a wright with this
                plan could build a smelter (to turn ore or scrap metal into ingots or castings), a lumber mill (to turn
                trees into boards), a glassworks (to turn sand into glass), a brickwork (to turn clay into bricks), or a
                cotton engine (to separate cotton fibers from the seeds), but they could not use the plan to make an
                installation that does all of these things. The extruder has multiple settings, allowing the user to
                determine what form the processed materials appear in. For example, a lumber mill can produce long
                square beams (useful for constructing buildings), flat panels (for furniture and doors), or round dowels
                (for axles or reinforcing wooden joints). A smelter can produce ingots, bars, pipes, billets, or slabs.
                A brickwork can make various sizes of bricks and tiles. Even the surplus material cast aside by the
                extruder might have additional uses - sawdust and other debris from a lumber mill can be burned for
                fuel, slag from a smelter can be ground up and mixed with water to form cement, and so on. Each day the
                materials extruder is operated at full capacity, it can produce up to 10 units of materials useful for
                crafting most commonplace objects and structures.

                the past is a difficulty 6 understanding numenera task each additional day into the past increases the
                difficulty by 1. The chrono engine is sensitive to interference from other time-altering devices,

                interference source within 1 mile (1.5 km) automatically triggers a GM intrusion and a depletion roll.
                For this reason, most pilots move the vehicle to a new location before time-traveling again.

                passengers. Two different control surfaces control the vehicle. One allows a driver to physically move
                the vehicle by extruding several sturdy legs. The legs can carry it up to an immediate distance each
                round. They adhere to almost any solid surface, including vertical surfaces or on the undersides of
                caverns, and can anchor the vehicle solidly in position. The second control surface unlocks only when
                the vehicle is locked into position, all legs anchored. Once the pod is secure, a pilot can shift into
                alternate dimensions along a transdimensional gradient that includes first parallel dimensions and then
                bizarre dimensions. After each shift, the vehicle requires at least 28 hours to recharge before it can
                attempt another shift. A user who becomes familiar with the vehicle and knows exact dimensional
                coordinates can input them to shift to a specific dimension. Otherwise, shifting into alternate
                dimensions is more exploratory.

                lifting these brave travelers into the void on a pillar of fire and thunder. As it ascends, most of the
                ascender is used up and falls back through the sky, burning up in the atmosphere. Only the pod at the
                tip goes high enough and fast enough that it reaches equilibrium so that it is constantly falling around

                back to Earth. Pinpointing a specifc location on the surface is difficult. The location where the pod
                ends up on the planet is imprecise - usually about 10d10 miles away from the intended destination or
                completely random. Landing, though automated, remains dangerous because of turbulence. The pod's power

                m). This creates a loud screaming noise and a lot of smoke. This burst of speed requires very smooth
                terrain (like salt flats or a frozen lake), or the vehicle might flip into the air and crash
                spectacularly. After each five hours of use, the scream wheeler must rest in the sun for at least one
                hour before it becomes operational again. One use of the burst of speed counts as one hour of normal
                driving. In practice, scream wheelers usually go much slower than their maximum distance per round,
                because most terrain and roads are not smooth enough for such fast movement without risking a fatal
                crash.

                with specifc directions, if they know them, or a general description of where they'd like to go. The
                craft can be designed to speak in the language of the crafter, though it has the capacity to pick up
                other languages at need. The craft pilots itself. A trip to the other children of the sun requires about
                four days of travel, while trips to nearby stars can take several days. A galaxy-spanning jaunt requires
                several months, while moving between galaxies requires fnding special transfer points that act as space
                tunnels. Fuel does not seem to be a concern. Several interior chambers provide passengers a place to
                live during trips. Rooms are specialized according to need, including a command chamber with
                viewscreens, a room where passengers can control built-in weapons (including a level 6 beam weapon that
                can be directed at enemy craft within 20 miles [32 km]), and various other rooms that can be customized

                Earth (destinations are frequently overshot, and landing is difficult). But it excels at interplanetary
                and interstellar journeys. Special engines (if that's even the right word) propel the craft at
                unimaginable speeds to cross even more unimaginable distances in relatively short periods of time.
